## 1. Introduction

This chapter introduces Replication Manager and explains how to install it. It contains the following sections:

- Overview
- System Requirements
- Installation and Uninstallation

### Overview

Replication Manager is a graphical tool for managing replication objects on Altibase. Altibase Database Administrators typically need to connect to all instances of Altibase on which replication objects are active. Using a Command Line Interface (CLI) such as iSQL, they need to jump around between console windows to perform replication tasks such as stopping, modifying, and starting target replication objects. This requires them to memorize the status of, and relationships between, replication objects, meaning that the burden of replication management grows exponentially as the number of replication objects increases linearly. Thanks to its Graphical User Interface (GUI), Replication Manager can help DBAs perform these tasks easily while visualizing all of their replication nodes in the same screen.

The major benefits of this tool are:

1. Compatible with multiple versions of Altibase.
1. Check the status of replication objects and the relationships between them at a glance. 
3. Manage replication objects with the click of a mouse.
4. Check the properties of replication objects and related objects. 
5. Monitor replication pairs and analyze their status, almost intuitively.

### System Requirements

This section discusses the system requirements for Replication Manager and compatible Altibase version.

#### Hardware Requirements

1. CPU: 800MHz Pentium or better

2. Main Memory: 512MB or more

3. Disk: 50MB or more free spaces (in addition to space required for the JRE)

4. Screen Resolution: 1024 x 768 pixels or higher

#### Software Requirements

##### Supported OS and Platforms
Replication Manager is distributed in Windows and Linux-compatible packages. 

| Package Name                                        | Operating System | Graphic System | JRE              |
| :-------------------------------------------------- | :--------------: | :------------: | :-----------: |
| ReplicationManager-win32.win32.x86.zip              | Windows          | win32          | JRE 6 included   |
| ReplicationManager-linux.gtk.x86.zip (JRE included) | Linux            | GTK            | Java 6 or higher |

##### Java Requirement
- Java Development Kit (JDK), or Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6 or later

Since Replication Manager for the Microsoft Windows system is bundled with the JRE 6, users do not need to install Java. However, package for Linux does not include JRE, therefore the user must configure the JRE and related environment variables appropriately to use Java.

#### Compatible Altibase version

- Altibase: 4.3.9 or higher

Since Replication Manager can work with different versions of Altibase at the same time, users must use the JDBC driver file appropriate for the Altibase to which you are connecting.

Please refer to [Importing a JDBC Driver File](#importing-a-jdbc-driver-file).

### Installation and Uninstallation

#### Download

Replication Manager can be downloaded from Altibase Customer Center at http://support.altibase.com/en/product. Replication Manager is provided in ZIP file format. 

#### Installation

To install it, simply unzip the file in the desired directory.

#### Uninstallation

To unistall it, simply delete the directory in which Replication Manager is installed. 

## 2. How to use Replication Manager

This chapter introduces the graphical user interface of Replication Manager. Then, it covers the steps to be taken to connect Replication Manager to Altibase database and describes how to use Replication Manager in detail. It is organized as follows:

- Understanding the User Interface
- Connecting to Altibase
- Working with Replication Manager

### Understanding the User Interface

This section introduces the overall user interface. 

The user interface of Replication Manager is organized as follows:

![48deb125f1f8d0bad9072829a57b02c7](media/ReplicationManager/48deb125f1f8d0bad9072829a57b02c7.png)

1. DB Connections: This is the entry point for the program and a database-centric view that represents the relationship between databases and replication objects in a tree structure.

2. Replication Pairs: This is a logical view that depicts replication objects in pairs. A pair of two replication objects that have the same name and interact with each other is called a "Replication Pair".

3. Map: This area graphically illustrates the physical layout and status of databases, replication objects, and the relationships therebetween.

4. Properties: This area shows the properties for the currently selected object (e.g. DB connection or replication object).

These four panes are intended to give DBAs a variety of ways of visualizing the same databases and replication objects. For example, the "Map" pane provides a convenient way to check the replication gap at a glance, while "Replication Pairs" provides a convenient way of handling replication objects as pairs without having to think about the databases on which they are working. So, these four panes complement each other. For example, when a replication object is selected in the "DB Connections" pane, the same replication object is also selected in the "Replication Pairs" and "Map" panes. In addition, the properties of the selected replication object will be displayed in the "Properties" pane. In other words, the three editable panes, "DB Connections", "Replication Pairs", and "Map", interact multidirectionally with each other, while the read-only pane, "Properties", receives information from the other three panes.

The "DB Connections" pane offers the following features:

- It provides a view that can be used to register, unregister, and edit database connections. 
- It shows meta information about connected databases, replication objects, and replication target tables in a tree structure for ease of navigation. 
- It provides a convenient way to manage databases and replication objects, including starting, stopping, creating, and dropping replication objects

The "Replication Pairs" pane offers the following features:

- It provides a convenient way to manage replication pairs without having to think about the underlying databases. 
- It also provides a way to manage replication objects, including starting and stopping them.

The "Map" pane offers the following features:

- It delivers the big picture of all registered databases and replication objects in an intuitive manner. 
- It also provides a way to control databases and replication objects.

### Connecting to Altibase

This section describes, in the form of a tutorial, the basic steps that must be taken in order to connect to an Altibase database. The usual workflow when working with Altibase is as follows:

1. Import a JDBC driver file to be used when connecting to an Altibase database. 
2. Add a database connection. 
3. Connect to the database. 
4. Conduct replication administration tasks as required. 
5. Disconnect from the database. 
6. Edit DB connection information. 
7. Manage Extra Host IP.
8. Remove the database if it is no longer needed.

Each procedure is conducted as described below.

#### Importing a JDBC Driver File

This section describes the steps involved in importing the appropriate version of the JDBC driver file into Replication Manager. 

Replication Manager can work with many different versions of Altibase simultaneously. So, it is necessary to import Altibase JDBC driver that is appropriate for the database to be connected. If a user wants to connect to two different Altibase databases, for example, versions 4.3.9.100 and 5.3.3.33 respectively, then the user is required to import two versions of the JDBC driver files into Replication Manager, and to give them different names, for example, "Altibase_4.3.9.100.jar" and "Altibase_5.3.3.33.jar". 

It is recommended to copy and use the JDBC driver of the Altibase server to be connected.

To import a JDBC driver, do the following: 

1. Click on the "JDBC driver manager" icon in the toolbar to open the "JDBC driver manager" dialog box.

2. In this dialog box, click on the "+" icon on the right to open the "Import JDBC driver file" dialog box, as shown below.

![5d9de880b8ffcff76f8f2fed4b5f50cf](media/ReplicationManager/5d9de880b8ffcff76f8f2fed4b5f50cf.png)

3. Select a JDBC driver file to import and give the file a name to be used in Replication Manager. The source file will be copied into the specified directory and renamed as specified. 

4. Close the "JDBC driver manager" dialog box.

Alternatively, users can also import a JDBC driver file when performing the "Adding a Database connection" task. 

#### Adding a Database Connection

1. Open the "New DB Connection" dialog by clicking on the "New DB Connection" icon in the main toolbar, or by right-clicking on the "DB Connections icon" in the "DB Connections" panel and then left-clicking on the "New DB Connection" item in the context menu that appears.
2. The "New DB Connection" dialog box shown below will appear. Fill in the input fields as described below.

![f6753230700743fd3fbdf8349161b408](media/ReplicationManager/f6753230700743fd3fbdf8349161b408.png)

- Basic Information

	- Connection Name: A unique connection name of up to 10 characters. The name must start with an alphabet, alphabets and numbers can be mixed.
	- Password: The password for the SYS user of the database.
	- DB Address: The IP address of the machine on which the database is installed.
	- DB Port: The port number required to access the database.
	- DB Name:  The name of the database.
	- JDBC driver: To use the appropriate version of the JDBC driver file, select the correct imported JDBC driver in the combo box. If the required JDBC driver file has not been imported yet, please import a new JDBC driver by clicking on the "JDBC driver manager" icon.

- Options

  - IP Address Type: Select the appropriate IP address type, IPv4 or IPv6.
  - NLS for Client: Choose the character set to use when translating data from the DBMS on the client side. (This option is not necessary when connecting to Altibase version 5.3.1 or higher.)
  

3. Click on the "Connection Test" button to ensure that the connection works as expected. 
4. Finally, click on the "Save" button.

#### Connecting to the Database

Once the previous task has been completed, you are ready to connect to a database, as shown below:

![6e97d198c19b208617582e4bcb6c9ea7](media/ReplicationManager/6e97d198c19b208617582e4bcb6c9ea7.png)

To connect to a database, complete the following steps:

1. Select the newly added database connection. Right-click on the newly added database to display the context menu, and then left-click on "Connect". This may take some time, depending on your environment. 
2. When you are successfully connected, you will see the replication objects in the target database. 
3. If the connection fails, a warning dialog appears, displaying some information that will be of help in successfully establishing a connection.

#### Working with the Connected Database

If you have followed the preceding steps successfully, you are ready to manage replication on the connected database.

#### Disconnecting from the Database

After finishing your work, it is necessary to close the connection with the database. To close a connection with a database, select the target database connection. Open the context menu by right-clicking on the target database, and then choose "Disconnect".

#### Editing DB Connection Information

It will sometimes be necessary to edit database connection information. For example, it may be necessary to change the account that is used to establish the database connection. It can only be executed when it is not connected to the database to be edited. There are four steps involved in editing database connection information.

1. Select the database for which it is desired to change connection information. To open the context menu, right-click on the database, and then choose "Edit" from the context menu. 
2. Make the required changes to the connection information. Click on the "Connection Test" button to ensure that the connection works as expected. 
3. The dialog box shown below will appear if the connection test is successful. Click on the "OK".
4. Finally, click on the "Save" button in the Edit dialog box. 

#### Managing Extra Host IP

If Altibase is installed on a device with multiple IP addresses and one of these addresses was used as Remote Host IP when creating a replicaiton object in another Altibase, this IP has to be either the DB Address of the registered database connection or Extra Host IP. Otherwise, the relationship between the database and the replication object may not be properly displayed in the Map window.
This can be executed regardless of the connection status. Select the database you wish to register or delete the Extra Host IP. Right-click on the database to open the context menu and select the "Manage Extra Host IP" item.

#### Removing a Database Connection

When a registered database is no longer in use, user might want to remove it from the DB Connections panel. To remove a database, select the target database connection. Open the context menu by right-clicking on the database connection to be removed, then left-click on "Remove" in the context menu.

### Working with Replication Manager

This section is intended to describe how to use Replication Manager in detail. It also describes the relationship between panes and objects.

Replication Manager abstracts database and replication objects and models six objects on that. Various ways of visualizing and manipulating the objects on three editable panes(DB Connections, Replication Pair, Map) are also provided. The six objects are as follows:

1. Replication Object
   It is an object created with the CREATE REPLICATION statement and the common object among panes at Replication Manager. Please refer to [Understanding the User Interface](#understanding-the-user-interface).
2. Replication Target Table Object
   This is a table that is designated, using the CREATE REPLICATION or ALTER REPLICATION statement, to be replicated between corresponding replication nodes.
3. DB Connections Object
   It is the root object of "DB Connection" object managing DB Connection. It is automatically created in "DB Connections" pane.
4. DB Connection Object
   It displays Altibase connection. Please refer to [Understanding the User Interface](#understanding-the-user-interface) for detailed information.
5. Replication Pairs Object
   It is the root object of "Replication Pair". It is automatically created in "Replication Pairs" pane.
6. Replication Pair Object
   It is a pair of corresponding replication objects having the same name, one residing on each of two different nodes. Please refer to [Understanding the User Interface](#understanding-the-user-interface).

Same objects shared by different panes may provide different functionalities according to the pane. For instance, Replication Object at Replication Pair pane provides "Edit Table List" function, but at Map pane it doesn't. This is to align functionalities to its context. The Replication Pair pane is to manage the replication object, while the Map pane is to provide overall system status information at a glance by showing the target databases and the replication objects as a graph.

#### DB Connections pane
