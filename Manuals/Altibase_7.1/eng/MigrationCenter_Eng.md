## 1. Introduction

This chapter introduces Migration Center and explains how to install it. This chapter consists of the following sections:

-   Overview

-   System Requirements

-   Installation and Uninstallation

### Overview

Migration Center is a database migration tool that either directly or indirectly copies generally compatible database objects and data. Most databases comply with international standards, but no database is exempt from manual database migration. Generally, manual database migration is complicated, time-consuming, and error-prone. Migration Center helps users migrate databases with only a few mouse clicks in Graphic User Interface (GUI) mode, and offers Command Line Interface (CLI) mode as well.

The major benefits of using this tool are:

1.  Database objects of the original database can be conveniently migrated to the target database (Alibase or Oracle) without any difficulties.
2.  Directly copies data of a source database to Altibase with a JDBC driver (the most popular and widely available interface for DBMS nowadays).
3.  Exports data to external files for later use in data importing to Altibase with iLoader. 
4.  Provides parallel execution options to shorten the migration process. By default, Migration Center automatically balances data migration load between a number of threads and also enables the user to manually split data over multiple threads. 
5.  Supports data type mapping of different data types between heterogeneous databases. Provides default type mapping for convenience and user-defined data type mapping for flexibility. 
6.  Provides GUI mode for better usability and CLI mode for special circumstances. 
7.  For schema migration, enables the user to modify DDL SQL statements for migrating database objects.



### System Requirements

This section discusses the system requirements for Migration Center and compatible database management systems.

-   Hardware Requirements
-   Software Requirements
-   Compatible Database Systems

#### Hardware Requirements

##### GUI Mode

-   CPU: Pentium III 800MHz or better

-   Main memory: 512MB or more

-   Disk: 150MB or more free space

-   Screen resolution: 1024 x 768 pixels or higher

##### CLI Mode

-   CPU: Pentium III 800MHz or better 
-   Main memory: 512MB or more 
-   Disk: 150MB or more free space

#### Software Requirements

-   Java Development Kit (JDK), or Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5 or higher

Migration Center is a pure Java application that uses Swing for GUI mode. It runs regardless of the user’s hardware and operating system, but relies on the JRE. The user is recommended to install Oracle, or IBM Java 5 or higher. To run Migration Center in GUI mode, the user’s environment must support Java Swing.

Since Migration Center is bundled with the JRE 7 for the 64-bit Microsoft Windows system, these users do not need to install the JRE. However, other operating system users must configure the JRE and related environment variables appropriately.

#### Compatible Database Systems

The compatible database systems that are migratable can be divided into Altibase or Oracle depending on the target database.

##### If Altibase is the target database:

If Altibase is the target database, the source database that can be migrated is as follows.

###### Destination Database

-   Altibase 5.5.1 or above

###### Source Database

-   Altibase: 4.3.9 or above

-   Oracle Database: 9i - 11g

-   Microsoft SQL Server: 2005 - 2012

-   Oracle MySQL: 5.0 - 5.5

-   Informix: 11.50

-   Oracle TimesTen: 7.0, 11.2

-   CUBRID: 8.4.1\~9.3.5(ISO-8859-1, UTF-8 charset)

-   Tibero: 5\~6

##### If Oracle is the target database:

If Oracle is the target database, the source database that can be migrated is as follows.

###### Destination Database

-   Oracle Database 10g - 11g

###### Source Database

-   Altibase: 4.3.9 or above

##### JDBC Driver

Migration Center is available for different versions of Altibase and other databases. This tool uses a JDBC driver for database connection, so it is important to prepare the appropriate JDBC driver for both source and destination databases. For user convenience, some JDBC drivers that are appropriate for use with supported databases are provided with Migration Center.

Please note that for legal reasons, the Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver file, MySQL Connector/J file, informix JDBC Driver file, and TimesTen JDBC driver file are not included in the package. Also, since TimesTen only supports type 2 driver, the migration must be performed on a machine that the TimesTen Client Package is installed.

Users can download the appropriate JDBC driver file from the following site:

1.  Microsoft does not support the JDBC driver for SQL Server 2005 according to the Microsoft Support Lifecycle(MSL) policy, and it also does not provide download link. Therefore, users should use the JDBC driver included in the database product they are using.
  
2.  Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server 2008, for 2008 R2, for 2012 can be downloaded from the link below. Since Migration Center has been tested with JDBC driver version 6.0 and JRE 7 environment, it is recommended for users to use the same driver version and JRE version. Also in Linux OS, the value of JAVA_HOME environment variable must be set to the path where the JRE 7 or higher is installed. If you want to use a version other than JDBC Driver 6.0, you need to check the driver version, compatible SQL Server version, and supported JRE version in the Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server Support Matrix.

## 2. Getting Started

This chapter describes the key concepts in migration, how to use Migration Center in GUI and CLI modes, and tools provided for user convenience. 

This chapter consists of the following sections:

-   Understanding Migration Center

-   Understanding User Interface

-   Tools

### Understanding Migration Center

This section explains the terminology and overall process of Migration Center.

-   Terms

-   Basic Concept

#### Terms

##### Project

The Migration Center project is a basic work unit that describes all aspects of migration. This includes what to migrate, where from and where to migrate (namely, the database or datafile type), and how to migrate database objects and table data. For more detailed information about migration options, please refer to Appendix A: Migration Options. Only one project can be open at any time.

#### Basic Concept

The overall process of Migration Center consists of five steps: Prepare, Build, Reconcile, Run, and Data Validation.

![](media/MigrationCenter/0e1eca129799717d226a7ee6a611eba8.jpg)

##### Prepare Step

The Prepare step is an implicit step in the migration project. This step ends with an open project that has all database connections established. To get there, the user may need to add connection information of the running database, open an existing migration project, or create a new migration project by either using preconfigured database connections or establishing database connections.

##### Build Step

The Build step performs initial surveys on the current status of the source and destination databases. This step retrieves information about database objects in the source and destination databases through database connections, and saves this information in the project directory. Since this information is used in other steps, it must reflect the most recent status. If any metadata is changed in the source database prior to the Run step, the Build, Reconcile, and Run steps must be re-executed to integrate changes.

##### Reconcile Step

The Reconcile step builds a complete migration plan on the current status. This step is mostly  28 Migration Center User’s Manual about making adjustments for differences between source and destination databases (namely, data types and tablespaces). This step enables the user to edit SELECT statements for fetching data from the source database and DDL statements to be executed on the destination database. For example, the user can specify which source database table is to be copied to which destination database tablespace.

Please remember that if changes are made to “Migration Options”, this step must be re-executed.

##### Run Step

The Run step executes the plan built in the Reconcile step. This step migrates schema and data either directly or indirectly. 

If the migration type in “Migration Options” is set to “DB to DB”, Migration Center creates database objects in the destination database (schema migration). Then, it copies data from the source database to the destination database (data migration). 

If the migration type in “Migration Options” is set to “DB to File,” SQL script files are created during migration. Nevertheless, the basic migration process is the same. 

##### Data Validation Step

The Data Validation step runs a check on migrated data. This step checks whether the data of a table that has a primary key and was migrated in the Run step is identical in the source and destination databases. If build step is performed as "Build User", this step checks the data validity of all tables that have a primary key. If build step is performed as "Build Table", this step checks the data validity of only migrated tables with a primary key. 

Data that differs between the source and destination databases is stored to CSV files during this step. The user can apply data of this file to the destination database with the “FILESYNC” menu or command. To shorten the duration of this step, the data sampling feature is enabled by default. To disable the data sampling feature and run a data validation check on all data, select the “Data Validation Options” submenu from the “Migration Options” menu, and change “Data Sampling” to “No”.



### Understanding User Interface

This section briefly describes GUI mode and CLI mode provided by the Migration Center. The details of two mode usages are discussed at "GUI Mode Quick Guide" and "CLI Mode Quick Guide".

#### Graphic User Interface(GUI) Mode 

GUI mode is a user-friendly interface and is the basic interface of Migration Center. GUI mode allows you to perform the entire migration process easily, and can be fine-tune "Reconciling the Project" step and changing the options. If the platform supports Java Swing from client computer to server, it can be executed in GUI mode.

The Migration Center GUI consists of the four panes shown below. Starting from the top left corner and moving clockwise, the four panes are Project, Information, Log, and DB Properties.

![](media/MigrationCenter/54ff6818cfe8f8b9110c2bac05ecb0f9.png)

##### Project Pane

The Project pane offers a project-centric view. This pane displays the open project, and its source and destination database connections. Only one project can be open at a time.

##### Information Pane

The Information pane offers a simple view of the project. This pane displays the current progress and remaining steps.

##### Log Pane

The Log pane displays the results of tasks performed by Migration Center in chronological order. This pane chooses information that might be of interest to the user from logs stored in the log subdirectory under the Migration Center directory.

##### DB Properties Pane

The DB Properties pane displays information about the source and destination databases configured for the project. 

#### Command Line Interface (CLI) Mode

The primary reason for using the CLI mode is to perform a fast "run" step. The "run" step, which takes the most time during the migration, creates the converted schema in the "Reconcile" step and migrates the data from the source database into the target database. Performing the "run" step in the CLI mode on the server where the database is installed, can increase the data transfer speed by reducing the communication cost compared to executing the "run" step in the GUI mode on the client computer.

Users can take advantage of both the convenience of GUI mode and the fast performance of CLI mode when you execute only the "Run" and "Validate" steps are performed in CLI mode after executing from "Start" to "Reconcile" in GUI mode

Another reason to use in CLI mode is to perform the migration in an environment where GUI mode is not allowed. Although the entire migration process can be performed in CLI mode, it also has limitations of character-based interface. For example, user is allowed to perform "Reconcile" step only with the default value in CLI mode.

### Tools

This section introduces how to use two types of utilities included in the Migration Center

#### PSM Converter for File

“PSM Converter for File” converts Oracle PL/SQL to Altibase PSM in independent file units. This tool reads a SQL file that contains Oracle PL/SQL statements, converts it into Altibase PSM, and then writes the results in a predefined SQL file. This file is provided with an HTMLformatted report file. This tool’s functionality is equivalent to the PSM Converter in the Reconcile step. For more detailed information about conversion rules, please refer to PSM Converter Rule List.

To execute this tool, select ”PSM Converter for File” from “Tools” in the main menu.

#### Generate Migration Error Report

“Generate Migration Error Report” reports problems that arise in Migration Center. If a project is opened, and this tool is executed, it collects problem tracking information (namely, log files and revision number information) and creates it as a zip file. The user only needs to attach the zip file to an email and send it to Altibase’s Customer Support with the user’s client registration information.

To execute this tool, select “Generate Migration Error Report” from “Tools” in the main menu.

## 3. GUI Mode Quick Guide

3.  Click the “OK” button at the bottom of the “New Project” dialog box.

#### Opening the Project

To open a project, select the “Open Project” submenu from the “Project” menu. A file “Open” dialog box appears. The user only needs to choose a project folder and click the “Open” button.

#### Configuring the Project

The user can configure the project’s basic strategy prior to setting project details. For further information, please refer to Migration Options.

#### Connecting to Source and Destination Databases

Establishing connections with the source and destination databases is essential to proceed to the Build step. To connect the databases for the project, select the “Connect” submenu from the “Project” menu, or right-click the open project and click “Connect.”

#### Building the Project

The Build step is indispensible to migration, yet simple to execute. 

1.  Click "Build User" or "Build Table" from the "Migration" menu or the main toolbar.
  
2.  A dialog box asking how to fetch records from each table in the source database appears. Select the desired method and click “OK”. For further information about the available options and explanations thereof, refer to Internal Activities.
  
3.   If "Build Table" has been selected, a dialog box shows up to list the names of migration target tables. When clicking the"![](media/MigrationCenter/f614c334dace127d00b84a2951b20ff2.png)" button, you can choose migration target tables with name search. After completing configuring the table list, click the "Build" button to proceed with the build step.
  
4.  A “Build” dialog box displaying the build progress appears. At completion, a “Report” button appears at the bottom. 
  
5.  If you click “Report”, an HTML report file is created in the project directory and the “Build Report” dialog box appears. This dialog box provides a link to the HTML report file. Once the “Report” button is clicked and an HTML report file is created, the “Build Report” submenu from the “Report” menu is activated. The user can open the “Build Report” dialog box at any time with this menu item.

#### Reconciling the Project

The Reconcile step is very important because it determines how to execute the Run step, and it requires some knowledge of both source and destination databases. For further information about this step, please refer to Migration Center Internals. The following is a simple guide:

1.  From the “Migration” menu, select “Reconcile”, or click the “Reconcile” icon in the main toolbar.
  
2.  Change or confirm the default data type mapping.

3.  Specify the Altibase tablespaces to which the source database is to be migrated.

4.  Change or confirm how to migrate partitioned tables in the source database to Altibase.
  
5.  Specify the Altibase tablespace to which each table or index in the source database is to be migrated.
  
6.  Check the SELECT statement for fetching data from each table of the source database, and make changes if necessary. 
  
7.  Check whether the DDL SQL statements to be used during the schema migration process is correct, and make changes if necessary.
  
8.  Click the “Report” button to generate a report for this step.

#### Running the Project

The Run step can be as easily executed as the Build step, but is irreversible. Please check all settings before proceeding any further.

1.  From the “Migration” menu, select the “Run” submenu, or click the “Run” icon in the main toolbar. 
2.  Click “OK” in the warning dialog box to confirm that every configuration is correct. 
3.  Review the progress and final report closely.

#### Validating the Project

The Data Validation step checks whether data migration was properly performed in the Run step.

1.  From the “Migration” menu, select the “Data Validation” submenu. 
2.  Click “OK” in the warning dialog box to confirm that every configuration is correct. The “Data Validation” dialog box appears and the Data Validation step is executed. 
3.  At completion, a “Report” button appears at the bottom. 
4.  If you click “Report”, an HTML report file is created in the project directory and the “Data Validation Report” dialog box appears. This dialog box provides a link to the HTML report file. Once the “Report” button is clicked and an HTML report file is created, the “Data Validation Report” submenu from the “Report” menu is activated and the user can open the “Data Validation Report” dialog box at any time with this submenu. 
5.  If there is a difference between the data of the source and destination databases in the report, the user can synchronize the data with the filesync feature.

The following is a simple guide for using filesync.

1.  From the “Migration” menu, select the “Migration Options” submenu. 
2.  Click “OK” in the warning dialog box. 
3.  Select “FILESYNC” in the “Operation” combo box from the “Data Validation Options” submenu, and click “OK”.

6.  Select the table to perform data synchronization on. 
7.  Click “Next” until the Reconcile step completes. 
8.  From the “Migration” menu, select the “Data Validation” submenu. 
9.  The “Data Validation” dialog box appears and filesync is executed. At completion, a “Report” button appears at the bottom. 
10.  Check that data difference has been solved in the report.

## 4. CLI Mode Quick Guide

This chapter provides a quick step guide for CLI mode users who are new to Migration Center.

### Quick Step Guide for CLI User

The user can easily perform migration in CLI mode with this quick step guide. The overall process is listed below.

1.  Prepare the project

    1.  Register database connection information and project

    2.  Set migration options
2.  Build the project 
3.  Reconcile the project 
4.  Run the project 
5.  Validate the project

#### Prepare the Project

The source/ destination database connection information and project registration are essential to perform migration. It is possible to register the project in CLI mode, but it is recommended to register in user-friendly in GUI mode.

To register the database connection information and projects in CLI mode, you must explicitly register it in Migration Center after modifying the registration file(register.xml). What you need to input in the registration file is the project name and the source / destination database connection information to be used in the project. Multiple projects can be registered at once.

The registration file must be located in the directory where the Migration Center is installed. Please refer to the comments and samples in the "register.xml" file for more details.

##### Register database connection information and project 

```
% ./migcenter.sh register register.xml
```

The source / destination database connection information and the project recorded in the registration file (register.xml) is to be registered in the Migration Center. The input project name should be unique, and the database connection information should be able to connect to the target database before registrations. When the project is successfully registered, the project name folder is automatically created and source/ destination database connect information is stored in Migration Center.

If either the project recorded in the registration file or the registration of the database connection information fails, all project and database connection registration recorded in the registration file are canceled.

You can use a name other than "register.xml" as the name of the registration file.

##### Set Migration Options 

The "options.xml" file is automatically created in the project folder when the project is registered. You can modify the options in the options.xml file directly in CLI mode. For details of the options, refer to the "Appendix A: Migration Options".

#### Build the Project 

```
% ./migcenter.sh build project_path
```

To perform the "Build" step, input the build command and the path of the target project. The number of table records in the source database is collected using the Approximate Counting Method by default.

#### Reconcile the Project

```
% ./migcenter.sh reconcile project_path
```

To perform the "Reconcile" step, input the reconcile command and the path of the target project. In CLI mode, user is not allowed to tune the "Reconcile" step due to the limit of character-based interface.

#### Run the Project

```
% ./migcenter.sh run project_path
```

To perform the "Run" step, input the run command and the path of the target project.

#### Validate the Project

```
% ./migcenter.sh diff project_path
```

To verify the data migrated properly in the "Run" step, input the diff command and the path of the target project.

```
% ./migcenter.sh filesync project_path
```

To match the different data between the source and destination databases using the diff command, input filesync command and the path of the target project.

## 5. Migration Center Internals

This chapter describes the main steps of Migration Center, namely the Build, Reconcile, Run, and Data Validation steps. This chapter consists of the following sections:

- Build Step
- Reconcile Step
- Run Step
- Data Validation Step


### Build Step

#### Purpose

The Build step not only collects information about database objects from the source and destination databases, but also provides a build report to make migration easier for the user. The report lists migratable database objects in the source and destination databases with byte size information. This informs the user of the scale of the migration project, and helps the user to estimate the necessary data volume and time.

The information gathered in this step is used throughout the entire migration process and must reflect the current status of the source and destination databases. If changes are made to the database objects in the source database after the Build step, all steps must be re-executed.

#### Output

-   Build reports: Several data volume analysis reports based on the current status of the source and destination databases are output in HTML format and stored in the project folder.

#### Internal Activities

This step consists of two internal activities; collecting information about database objects from both databases, and generating a Build report based on that information.

The collecting information can be started as either "Build User" or "Build Table".

-   Build User: Collects all migratable object information of the user connected to the source database
  
-   Build Table: Configure a list of tables to be migrated among the tables of the user connected to the source database. And collects object information of the selected tables, and constraints and indexes dependent on the selected tables

For more information on the object types that can be migrated, refer to the "Appendix B: Migratable Database Objects".

When the user starts the build step, the "Table Counting Method" dialog box appears. The user can choose one of the following options:

-   Approximate Counting Method:  Retrieves the number of table records by referring to the statistical value of the source database. This value is affected by the accuracy of the statistical value
  
-   Exact Counting Method:  Retrieves the exact number of table records by executing the COUNT function on every table in the source database

Of the two methods, the approximate counting method performs faster whereas, the exact counting method yields more accurate results.

The method chosen does not affect the database schema and data migration. It only affects the accuracy of the data migration progress percentage provided at the Run step in GUI mode. This is because the data migration progress is displayed as the time elapsed and the percentage of (number of migrated records / total number of records). With this, the user can estimate the total amount of time required to complete data migration. 

For more detailed information about how to execute the Build step, please refer to Building the Project.



### Reconcile Step

#### Purpose

The Reconcile step builds a migration plan. Migration Center users should have a plan on how to migrate the database objects of each database. Migration Center cannot migrate all database objects to Altibase databases. However, it makes migration easier by allowing users full control over migration. 

Altibase offers high performance of an in-memory database and high capacity of on-disk database in a single database. Altibase generally stores frequently used and low-latency data in memory tablespaces, and the rest of the data in disk tablespaces. 

For more detailed information about tablespaces in Altibase databases, please refer to the *Administrator’s Manual.*

#### Output

-   Reconcile reports: Several reports that specify which database objects to migrate and how to migrate them in the project folder.
  
-   SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts: Sample SQL files to create and drop database objects in the destination database are provided in the project folder for user convenience. However, these files are not used in any step.
  
    -   DbObj_Create.sql: A SQL script file for creating database objects to be migrated. 
    -   DbObj_Drop.sql: A SQL script file for dropping database objects having the same names as those to be migrated. 
-   DbObj_Unsupported.sql: A SQL script file for creating unsupported database objects.
  
-   PL/SQL conversion reports: Several reports generated by the PL/SQL Converter.

    -   sqlconv.html: A HTML report that compares the difference between source and converted PL/SQL. 
-   sqlconv_src.sql: A report that contains the input PL/SQL statements to be converted in text format. 
    -   sqlconv_dest.sql: A report that contains converted PL/SQL statements and comments listing the applied conversion rules in text format.

#### Internal Activities

Although the Reconcile step is very important and can get complicated, the wizard is as easy to use as a UI. For further information about how to start the Reconcile step, please refer to Reconciling the Project in Chapter 3.

##### Reconcile Wizard Dialog Box

Users can check and modify the default settings in wizard dialog box. The wizard guides the user step by step, but the user can also go to any step by selecting it in the left pane.

#####  “Data Type Mapping” Step

The “Data Type Mapping” step maps data types between heterogeneous databases. Please note that small differences between data types can cause unexpected data loss and truncation during data migration. For more detailed information, please refer to Data Type Mapping in Appendix C.

#####  “PSM Data Type Mapping” Step

The “PSM Data Type Mapping” step maps PSM data types between heterogeneous databases. This step is only activated for Oracle to Altibase PSM Migration or TimesTen to Altibase PSM Migration. All configurations specified in this step are reflected to target DDL in the “SQL Editing” step later on.

##### “Tablespace to Tablespace Mapping” Step

The “Tablespace to Tablespace Mapping” step maps tablespaces between the source and destination databases. When tablespace mapping is set, contents of the tablespace are also mapped to the selected tablespace. This step creates a default tablespace map, and this map can be altered with the “Object to Tablespace Mapping” submenu.

##### "Object to Tablespace Mapping" Step

The “Object to Tablespace Mapping” step maps each table and index by dragging and dropping them to tablespaces in the destination tablespace. Whenever a map changes, the necessary total storage sizes for tablespaces in the destination database are recalculated. Internally, a database object size is accurately retained in bytes, but is rounded to megabytes in the dialog box. Therefore, the total size of a tablespace may not be equivalent to the sum of its contents.

##### "Select Editing" Step

The “Select Editing” step enables the user to edit the SELECT statement for fetching data from a table in the source database. The user can add hints or WHERE clauses, and immediately check the edited statement. Click the “Restore” button to undo changes. 

##### "Unacceptable Name" Step

The "Unacceptable Name" step shows objects that violate the unquoted object name rules in the target database. This includes objects with special characters or spaces in the name, and creation fails during the run phase. If the user selects the "Use Double-quoted Identifier" check box, the user can avoid creating objects by wrapping only the problem names in double quotes."

##### “SQL Editing” Step

The “SQL Editing” step allows the user to view and edit the DDL statements for schema migration. The user can refer to the source DDL, and directly edit the DDL statements that Migration Center will apply on the destination database. SQL statements for creating procedures, functions, triggers, and views are all displayed in PSM type. Tick the check box to select which object type within the PSM category to edit. These objects are displayed in the “Done” or “To-Do” list pane. If an object requires user confirmation, it is displayed in the todo list; otherwise, it is displayed in the done list. Click an object name in a list to view its source and destination DDL. Edit the DDL statement of an object belonging to the to-do list, then click the “Save” button, and the object will move to the done list. The migration of an object in the done list can unexpectedly fail in the Run step. In this case, the user must check the “Missing Cause” in the Run report, find the error cause, and manually migrate the object. DDL statements of PSM objects can be output as a file for users who prefer text editors. This functionality and instructions on its use are provided in the offline pane of the PSM object type. For Oracle or TimesTen to Altibase migration, the PL/SQL Converter converts the DDL statement of the PSM type object to an Altibase-compatible format. Please note that although most of the syntax is converted, statements containing semantic logic are not converted. 

> Note: Migration Center generates a dependency graph between objects in the source and destination databases in the Build step. If the user changes this dependency while editing destination DDL statements, migration cannot be guaranteed for the object and related objects.



### Run Step

#### Purpose

The Run step copies database objects in the source database to the destination database or external files, depending on migration options.

After the Run step is complete, Run reports that contain results of this step are generated. These results may be the most important to the user. The RunReport4Summary.html report file outputs the overall result by comparing the number of database objects and table records in the source and destination databases. The RunReport4Missing.html report file outputs in detail any failure. 

Data that failed to be migrated is collected in the “db2db” or “db2file” folder in the project folder. These two folders store data files and form files available for use with iLoader (the command-line data import/export tool for Altibase databases), and also scripts to easily import the generated data files to the database with iLoader. “iLoaderIn.sh” is the main script that executes the “iLoaderIn.number.sh” script which runs iLoader on other script files and tables.

#### Output

-   RunReport4Summary.html: A summary report file that outputs the overall result of migration. 
-   RunReport4Missing.html: A missing report file that outputs information about data that failed to be migrated, and the error cause. 
-   DbObj_Failed.sql: A file that outputs a list of failed SQL statements and the error cause.
-   The db2db folder: A subfolder in the project directory, where data that failed to be migrated is saved. This folder is only available if the “DB to DB” option is selected for “Migration Type” and “No” is selected for “Batch Execution.” 
-   The db2file folder: A subfolder in the project directory, where all output is saved if the “DB to File” option is selected for “Migration Type”.

#### Internal Activities

The user can execute the Run step with a single mouse click in GUI mode, or a single command in CLI mode. For further information, please refer to Running the Project or Executing the Run and Data Validation Steps in CLI Mode.

Internally, this process consists of three steps to avoid database object dependencies: the PreSchema, Table & Data, and PostSchema steps. For example, index objects are migrated in the PostSchema step, after the Table & Data step is completed. This is because it is usually faster to insert data without an index, than with an index. Each step performs the following:

1.  PreSchema: Migrates sequence objects

2.  Table & Data: Migrates table objects and data

3.  PostSchema:

    1.  Queue: Migrates queue objects

    2.  Constraints: Migrates constraints, namely unique, primary key, foreign key, and check constraints
    
3.  Index: Migrates index objects
  
4.  Synonym: Migrates private synonym objects
  
5.  Procedures, functions, materialized views, views, typesets and triggers: Depends on the database management system and its version



### Data Validation Step

#### Purpose

The Data Validation step checks whether data migration was properly performed in the Run step. At completion, the user is provided with a Data Validation report for post processing. This report offers information about the source and destination databases, a list of successfully validated tables, and the number of occurrences of data accordance and difference. 

The user can decide whether to re-execute the Run step or use filesync. The user is recommended to use filesync when the occurrence of data difference is low, but re-execute the Run step when the occurrence of data difference is high.

#### Restrictions

-   The Data Validation step can only be performed on a table with a primary key constraint. 
-   LOB columns are excluded as targets for data comparison.

#### Output

-   Data Validation report: A report containing a summary with information, namely the list of validated tables and the occurrences of data accordance and difference is output to the project directory. 
-   Validation directory: A subdirectory in the project directory that stores different data. This directory is valid only if “YES” is selected for the “Write to CSV” option in the “Data Validation Options” submenu.

#### Internal Activities

The Data Validation step can be executed with a single click in GUI mode, or a single command in CLI mode. For further information, please refer to Validating the Project or Executing the Run and Data Validation Steps in CLI Mode. 

Internally, the Data Validation step is executed as below. 

The data to be validated is fetched from the source and destination databases and compared. If a difference in data is detected and “Write to CSV” in the “Data Validation Options” submenu is set to “Yes”, the different data is stored in CSV format files in the validation folder. Regardless of the option, summary information is always output to the Data Validation report.



## Appendix A: Migration Options

Migration Options affect the migration project. They can be edited by selecting the “Migration Option” menu item from the Migration menu in GUI mode. Migration Options can usually be edited right after the project is created. 

The primary option is the Migration Type: either “DB to DB” or “DB to File”. 

-   DB to DB Migration Options

-   DB to File Migration Options

> Note:  MigrationCenter uses the SQL parser for Oracle provided by Third Party to migrate Tibero's Procedure, Function, View, Materialized View, and Trigger objects. Therefore, objects created with Tibero native syntax that is incompatible with Oracle grammar can cause parsing errors during conversion. In this case, the user must manually translate the syntax.





## Appendix C: Data Type Mapping

Migration Center’s policy for mapping data types between heterogeneous databases is to minimize the loss of data. However, the user may wish to customize the way that data is mapped, even if it incurs the loss or corruption of data. To satisfy this requirement, Migration Center also allows the user to edit the data type mapping table.

This section explains how to check and customize the default data type mapping for an existing project. It also provides default data type mapping tables.

-   Manipulating Data Type Mapping

-   Default Data Type Mapping Tables



### Manipulating Data Type Mapping

The user can check the default data type mapping and modify the way that data is mapped using the following methods:

1.  Perform the Reconcile step for the project. 
2.  At the Data Type Mapping step, select the data type to manipulate and then click on the “Change” button. 
3.  Assign the new data type as desired and set precision and/or scale values.



### Default Data Type Mapping Tables

#### Oracle Database to Altibase

| Index | Source        | Destination     | Issue                                                        |
| ----- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | CHAR          | CHAR            | CHAR type columns defined with character length in Oracle are automatically converted to CHAR type columns with byte length in Altibase, because in Altibase, CHAR type columns can be defined only with byte length. |
| 2     | NCHAR         | NCHAR           | The explicit sizes of the source and destination NCHAR columns are the same, e.g. NCHAR(10) -> NCHAR(10). <br/>However, in the Oracle JDBC driver, the size of a national character column is defined as the number of bytes used, whereas in the Altibase JDBC driver, the size of a national character column is defined as the number of characters that are stored. Please note that this means that the resultant column in Altibase will be two or three times as large as necessary. |
| 3     | VARCHAR2      | VARCHAR         | The potential data loss can be occurred due to the different maximum size between Oracle VARCHAR2 and Altibase VARCHAR, which are 32,767 bytes and 32,000 bytes, respectively. VARCHAR2 type columns defined with character length in Oracle are automatically converted to VARCHAR type columns with byte length in Altibase, because in Altibase, VARCHAR type columns can be defined only with byte length. |
| 4     | NVARCHAR2     | NVARCHAR        | The column sizes differ, for the same reason as NCHAR. The potential data loss can be occurred since the maximum size of Oracle NVARCHAR2(32,767 bytes) is greater than that of the Altibase, which is 32,000 bytes. |
| 5     | LONG          | CLOB            |                                                              |
| 6     | NUMBER        | NUMBER          | NUMBER type columns defined without precision and scale in Oracle are converted to the same NUMBER type columns without precision and scale for Altibase. *Both Oracle and Altibase internally handle NUMBER type columns defined without precision and scale as FLOAT type in the database. |
| 7     | FLOAT         | FLOAT           |                                                              |
| 8     | BINARY FLOAT  | FLOAT           |                                                              |

### Automatic Correction of Character Column Length Considering Heterogeneous Character Set

When the character sets of the source and destination databases are different during migration, character data types (CHAR, VARCHAR) require length conversion.
For example, if the source database is set to the MS949 character set that requires a maximum of 2 bytes per character storage, and the target database is set to the UTF8 character set that requires 3 bytes per character, the character data of the target database is required to migrate without truncation. The size of the type should be 1.5 times the original.

Migration Center automatically performs this length conversion, and the length correction formula for character data types is as follows.

```
Dest. Size = Ceil(Correction Factor * Src. Size)
Correction Factor = Dest. MaxBytes / Src. MaxBytes
* MaxBytes = The maximum number of bytes required to store one character
```

However, if MaxBytes of the original is 1 or the correction factor is less than 1, the length conversion is not performed.

The MaxBytes and correction factors of the source and target databases can be found on the summary page of the build report.

#### Precautions

For large tables, the length of data storage in the target database can be much larger than the original due to length correction. If there is a guarantee that the data will not be truncated without converting the length, the length can be manually specified in the reconcile step.

#### Support Character Set for Each Database

For character sets not listed in the table below, Migration Center does not perform length correction.

## Appendix D: Mapping Default Values

The default values for Altibase table columns are mostly compatible with the default values for the source database. 

However, the default value policy can differ among heterogeneous databases. In the event of such exceptional situations, Migration Center converts source database values according to the Altibase policy. 

This appendix provides a mapping table for default values according to which Migration Center converts source database default values to comply with Altibase.

### Mapping Table for Default Values

Prior to migrating data, Migration Center creates a table identical to the source database table in the migration destination database. Migration Center first creates a CREATE TABLE statement with the equivalent attributes as the source database table. To set the same default values for both source table columns and target table columns, Migration Center converts the default values in the following mapping tables and specifies them in the CREATE TABLE statement, when creating the statement. Default values excluded from the table are specified in the statement without being changed.

> Note: Some default values that are not changed can be incompatible with source and destination databases. If necessary, you must manually alter the default value for the CREATE TABLE statement in the DDL Editing window at the Reconcile Step. 



#### Default Value Mapping Policy

Default values of most of the original database are compatible with the target database without any modifications. However, Migration Center converts source database default values according to the policy of the target database system for the following exceptions.

-   The CHARACTER data type with a zero length string as the default value: Altibase identifies zero length strings as NULL; therefore, the default value is not specified. 
-   The DATE data type with a string expression as the default value: Since the default format for the DATE data type differs among source databases, Migration Center specifies a comment which includes the DEFAULT keyword in the CREATE TABLE statement, instead of the default value. If necessary, the user must manually set the default value later on, by referring to the comment. However, if the source database is the one among the MySQL, TimesTen or CUBRID, Migration Center automatically converts default values as shown below. 
-   The default value specified with a function: A function which is listed in the following table is converted accordingly, only if the function is exclusively specified as the default value in the source database. Other functions or expressions of a complex form are converted without being changed. If necessary, the user must manually change them later on.

## Appendix E: PSM Converter Rule List

Migration Center provides DDL SQL texts for creating PSM type database objects with the PSM converter for Oracle or TimesTen 11.2 to Altibase Migration. 

The PSM converter uses rules to convert DDL SQL texts, and these rules fall into the following three categories:

-   CONVERTED: Convertible

-   REMOVED:  Inconvertible, but may be removable

-   TODO: Neither convertible nor removable

If a TODO rule is applied to a PSM object, then it will show up in the To-do list pane. If not, then it will show up in the Done list pane. 

If the version scope is given for a rule, it means that the rule applies to only the specified Altibase version. On omission, the rule applies to all Altibase versions. 

When converting several SQL statements, end each SQL statement with a slash (‘/’) to separate them.

## Appendix F: FAQ



### Common

#### FAQ 1. OutOfMemoryError occurs during data transfer.

##### Cause

This error can occur due to a lack of memory while several threads are inserting data into the target database through batch operations.

##### Solution

According to the error message output from OutOfMemoryError, there are two cases as below.

###### \<Java heap space\>

Depending on the situation, you can choose between the two methods below.

-   Change performance property values to reduce memory usage

1.  Open the project. 
2.  Click the menu "Migration" -> "Migration Options". 
3.  Lower the Batch Size and Thread Count values

-   Increase the maximum amount of memory the program can use

1.  Open the executable file (migcenter.bat or migcenter.sh) with the editor. 
2.  Set the value of the option '-Xmx' that sets the maximum heap size in the JVM to be higher than the existing value.

> Note: On Windows 32 bit machines, you can set Xmx values up to 1.5 GB due to OS dependency.

###### \<PermGen space\>

1. Open the executable file (migcenter.bat or migcenter.sh) with the editor. 
2. Set the '-XX: MaxPermSize' option to set the maximum size of the permanent generation space in the JVM above the existing value.

###### \<Metaspace\>

If the version of the JVM you are using is Java 8 or higher, the lack of space in Metaspace may be the cause. Metaspace, implemented since Java 8, is a replacement for PermGen (permanent generation space).

* Open the executable file (migcenter.bat or migcenter.sh) with an editor.
* Option to set the maximum size of permanent generation space in JVM
  Change '-XX: MaxPermSize' to an option that determines the maximum size of the metaspace, and modify it higher than the existing value.

- - Before change: -XX:MaxPermSize=128m
  - After change: -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256 m

#### The NOT NULL constraint on a table column whose data type is LOB is not migrated.

##### Cause

It is a phenomenon that the Migration Center arbitrarily removes the NOT NULL constraint on the LOB column. 

The Migration Center inserts data into the target database using a query that contains parameters (for example, “insert into tablename values (?,?)”). 

Unlike other columns, Altibase processes data into LOB columns by initializing data to null first, then receiving data through LOB Locator and inputting data. Therefore, if the column has a NOT NULL constraint, the insertion is failed because the data cannot be initialized to null. 

In order to overcome this difference, the Migration Center removes the NOT NULL constraint on the LOB column to perform data migration. For more detailed information, refer to the  *General Reference* - 1. Data Type - LOB Data Type - Restrictions. 

Because Oracle performs constraint checking only at commit time, you can insert data even under these conditions.

##### Solution

After the migration, execute an SQL statement that adds a NOT NULL constraint to the corresponding column in Altibase

#### Database Character Set Notes

Generally, it is recommended to use the same DB character set of the source database and target database.  
If you need to specify different character sets because of special circumstances, you should check whether each DB character set is compatible. If you migrate data between incompatible character sets, the data may be corrupted.

##### Example

1.  From source database KSC5601 to Destination database UTF8:  
    Migratable  
    KSC5601 Korean data can be written in UTF8. Therefore, each character set is compatible with each other.  
    **Note**: Because the data length can be longer, you need to increase the size of the character type column when you relocate the table object.
    
2.  From source database KSC5601 to Destination database GB231280:  
    Not migratable  
    KSC5601 Korean data cannot be written as GB231280. Therefore, each character set is incompatible with each other.  
    If data migration is required under these conditions, the table column data types CHAR and VARCHAR of the target database should all be changed to NCHAR and NVARCHAR, and data transfer must be performed.

##### JDBC & Migration Center Character Set Process

1.  When fetching data from the source database, get the char data as the source database DB character set and store it in a byte array.
2.  Convert the data stored in the byte array to UTF-16 format and store it in a String object of Java base type.
3.  Pass the String object to the PreparedStatement object that inserts the data into the target database with the setString function. 
4.  JDBC driver converts the String object into data into the DB character set of the target database and insert them into the target database.

#### The program terminates abnormally while selecting the JDBC driver file.

##### Cause

This is an error that can occur when running the Migration Center in a Windows environment. While selecting the JDBC driver file when registering the connection information, changing the directory may cause the problem that the program terminates abnormally. This is a Java JVM crash caused by a communication problem between the JVM and the Windows operating system. Users can check for the Java crashes that usually occurs in the old version of the JVM through the link below.

<http://www.java.com/en/download/help/error_hotspot.xml>

##### Solution

Install the latest version of the JRE, modify the JAVA_HOME path in the migcenter.bat file, and rerun the Migration Center.

#### When running the CLI Mode, UnsatisfiedLinkError: /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/lib/amd64/libawt_xawt.so: libXrender.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory has occurred. 

This error occurs when the 64-bit libXrender.so file is requested by the JVM, but the package is not installed in the OS.

##### Cause

This usally occurs when you install a 32-bit JRE on a 64-bit device and try to run the Java program by using it.

##### Solution

After installing a new JRE that matches the bit value of the device, change JAVA_HOME to the appropriate location. Debian-like Linux installs a package by executing the following command. 

```
sudo apt-get install libXrender1
```

#### When Running the Migration Center, the message "Could not create the java virutal machine" is displayed and the startup fails.

##### Cause

This is an error that can occur when the maximum memory allocation value (-Xmx) set in bat and sh is lager than the memory allocated by the system. In particular, this error is frequently reported in Window O/S 32 bit

##### Solution

Change the value of -Xms -Xmx in bat and sh according to the user environment, and then restart Migration Center.



### Oracle

#### FAQ 1. The error message 'ORA-01652 unable to extend temp segment by 128 in tablespace TEMP' is printed.

##### Cause

This error is caused by a lack of Oracle's temporary tablespace space during large-volume query processing.

##### Solution

The temporary table space for the connected user must be extended.

#### FAQ 2. During the Run phase, error message 'Fetch data from source database has been failed. Stream has already been closed' is printed and migration of some data is failed.

##### Cause

Tables containing LONG or LONG RAW and LOB columns can cause problems during data migration. Below is an excerpt from the Oracle JDBC Developer's Guide (link).

12. Java Streams in JDBC - Streaming LONG or LONG RAW Columns

Because the column data remains in the communications channel, the streaming
mode interferes with all other use of the connection. Any use of the connection,
other than reading the column data, will discard the column data from the
channel.

In Oracle, data transmission of a LONG or LONG RAW column is done through a stream. If stream of other data types also is transmitted through the same connection, the data transmission can be interrupted. This means that if a LONG or LONG RAW column and a LOB column are in the same table, it cannot guarantee that the data in the table will succeed. For this reason, Oracle does not recommend using this configuration.

##### Solution

The table cannot be migrated via the Migration Center.

#### When you start the Reconcile step, the error message 'Unable to find any volatile tablespace to store temporary tables in the destination database' is displayed.

##### Cause

If there is a global temporary table among the list of migration objects of the source database, Oracle, a volatile tablespace must exist in the target database, Altibase. Oracle's global temporary tables are migrated to Altibase's temporary tables, and Altibase's temporary tables can only be stored in volatile tablespaces. (Refer to the manual: *SQL Reference - 3.* Data Definition Language - CREATE TABLE - Description) 

When performing the Reconcile step, the Migration Center takes a list of Altibase tablespaces that the user can access and tries to map tablespaces and tables between databases. At this time, this error occurs when there is no accessible volatile tablespace in Altibase to be mapped for a global temporary table in Oracle.

##### Action

Create a volatile tablespace in the target database, Altibase, grant access privileges, and then perform the reconcile step again.

#### SQLException: Protocol violation occurs during data migration.

##### Cause

An OOM error occurred during communication and it was lost, and a protocol violation error was returned.

##### Solution

Increase the maximum memory size that the program can use.

1. Open the executable file (migcenter.bat or migcenter.sh) with an editor.
2. Modify the value of option '-Xmx', which determines the maximum heap size in the JVM, than the existing value.

#### Various SQLExceptions can occur after an OutOfMemoryError occurs during data migration.

During a large amount of data migration, there are several cases in which there are multiple SQLException related to fetch or bind in Oracle. In this case, if only one of the tables is successful in table mode, the error caused by OOM can be suspected.

Example) 

Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: Fail to convert to internal representation
at oracle.jdbc.driver.CharCommonAccessor.getBigDecimal(CharCommonAccessor.java:414)

Invalid column type: getCLOB not implemented for class oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CVarcharAccessor

##### Cause

Various malfunctions are possible after the OOM occurs inside the Oracle JDBC driver.

##### Solution

Refer to OutOfMemoryError in the Common section.

#### NullPointerException may occur during the build phase.

When the source database is Oracle 9i, 10, the following NullPointerException may occur during the build phase due to Oracle JDBC driver compatibility error:

Fail to retrieve Source DDL: java.lang.NullPointerException
at oracle.jdbc.driver.T4C8Oall.getNumRows(T4C8Oall.java:1046)
at oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CPreparedStatement.executeForRows(T4CPreparedStatement.java:1047)
at oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement.executeMaybeDescribe(OracleStatement.java:1207)
at oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement.doExecuteWithTimeout(OracleStatement.java:1296)
at oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatement.executeInternal(OraclePreparedStatement.java:3608)
at oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatement.executeQuery(OraclePreparedStatement.java:3652)

at com.altibase.migLib.meta.SrcDbMeta_Oracle_9_0_0_0.getSrcDdlDbmsMetaData(SrcDbMeta_Oracle_9_0_0_0.java:2251)

##### Cause

Oracle JDBC Driver compatibility issues

##### Solution

Replace the JDBC driver file for Oracle in MigrationCenter with the JDBC driver file for your Oracle DBMS.



### MS-SQL

#### When "Test" button is pressed during connection information registration, connection is failed with error message

##### Cause

During registering MS-SQL connection information, when "Test" button is clicked, the following error message may be displayed:

-   “Migration Center can support MS-SQL user who has a single schema only.”

-   “User doesn't have appropriate schema in target database.”

Registration is not allowed because the schema relationship of the user of the connection information is incompatible with Altibase. 

MS-SQL has a different relationship between users and schemas from that of Altibase. Altibase has a structure that a single schema is assigned to each user and the database object is dependent on the schema. On the other hand, in MS-SQL, a single user is allowed to have from zero to multiple schemas, and each schema has its own database objects. the Migration Center allows connection information registration only if the MS-SQL user owns only one schema.

Therefore, if an MS-SQL user has no schema or multiple schemas, it is unable to register a connection information with that user due to schema structure difference.

##### Solution

Let the user of the connection information have only one schema.

#### When the "Test" button is pressed during connection information registration, the program stops.

##### Cause

It is presumably due to a conflict between the JVM installed on the appliance and the JVM embedded in the Migration Center. This problem may be shown up when the running operating system is Windows and a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed before installing a Migration Center.

##### Solution

You should open the executable file migcenter.bat with an editor and change the value of the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the location of the JRE already installed on the machine. The JRE should be changed to Java SE 5.0 or later.

#### The error message 'Unable to insert (or update) NULL into NOT NULL column.' is printed and data migration is failed.

##### Cause

This is because the difference between databases on how to handle zero-length string in column with not null constraint. MS-SQL allows inserting a zero-length string into a table column that is subject to a NOT NULL constraint. In Altibase, a zero-length string means NULL, so it does not allow inserting a zero-length string into a table column that is subject to a NOT NULL.

#####  Solution

Reconcile phase - In DDL Editing, delete the NOT NULL constraint from the Destination DDL of the corresponding table and click the "Save" button to save it.

#### Migration of duplicate foreign key is failed..

##### Cause

MS-SQL allows duplicate foreign keys while Altibase does not. So, only one foreign key will be migrated.

##### Action

In the “Missing” tab of the report created after the Run step, you can see the foreign keys that failed to escalate.



### Altibase

#### When migrating Altibase version 5.1.5 or lower, the characters are broken.

##### Cause

Altibase version 5.1.5 or lower does not support globalization, so JDBC does not know how to handle the character set of the database.

##### Action

You must include the character set value (for example, KSC5601) set in the destination database in the encoding option of the corresponding database connection information in the Migration Center. Here's how to check the Altibase character set.

-   Version 4.3.9 \~ 5.1.5:  
    SELECT VALUE1 FROM V\$PROPERTY WHERE NAME = 'NLS_USE';

-   Version 5.3.3 or later:  
    SELECT NLS_CHARACTERSET FROM V\$NLS_PARAMETERS;

#### In the Reconcile step, "Tablespace to Tablespace Mapping" does not show a specific tablespace.

##### Cause

The user in the connection information at the Migration Center does not have privilege to access to the tablespace.

##### Solution

Grant the Altibase user access to the tablespace.

#### When migrating Altibase version 4.5.1.0 or lower, it fails to retrieve information of a column whose data type is BLOB, byte, or nibble.

##### Cause

The Altibase JDBC driver of the corresponding version cannot return the BLOB, byte, or nibble data type to UNKOWN to know the column data type.

##### Solution

Tables with BLOB, byte, and nibble data types are migrated using aexport and iloader.

#### Some data of bit, varbit, and nibble data types migrated from Altibase 6.1.1 and earlier versions do not match the original database.

##### Cause

When the Altibase 6.1.1 or lower JDBC driver inserts bit, varbit, or nibble type data in batch execution, it fails to migrate some data normally.

##### Solution

Open the project, click the menu Migration-Migration Option, select 'No' for Batch Execution, and perform data migration.



### Informix

#### Java.sql.SQLException: Encoding or code set not supported in Informix JDBC Driver during data migration." 

The following SQLException occurred while fetching from Informix during data migration. This is an exception that occurs when retrieving this value when a byte of a multi-byte character is input to the Informix DB while being cut off.

Example) 

java.sql.SQLException: Encoding or code set not supported.
at com.informix.util.IfxErrMsg.getSQLException(IfxErrMsg.java:412)
at com.informix.jdbc.IfxChar.fromIfx(IfxChar.java:235)
at com.informix.jdbc.IfxRowColumn.a(IfxRowColumn.java:380)
at com.informix.jdbc.IfxRowColumn.a(IfxRowColumn.java:282)
at com.informix.jdbc.IfxSqli.a(IfxSqli.java:4657)
at com.informix.jdbc.IfxResultSet.a(IfxResultSet.java:666)
at com.informix.jdbc.IfxResultSet.b(IfxResultSet.java:638)
at com.informix.jdbc.IfxResultSet.getString(IfxResultSet.java:724)
at com.altibase.migLib.run.databinder.DataBinder.getValuesFromSrc(DataBinder.java:445)

##### Cause

If an Informix DB is entered with bytes of multi-byte characters truncated, an exception occurs when retrieving this value.

##### Solution

Add IFX_USE_STRENC = true to Informix connection properties.

### MySQL

#### When the data type of a table column is VARCHAR or CHAR with a size of 1 or 2, data of size 1 is migrated to null.

##### Cause

If you find that the MySQL JDBC driver returns a null value when importing data with a size of 1, it is probably a MySQL JDBC driver issue.

##### Action

You need to replace the driver with version 5.0.8 of MySQL Connector / J (link). If the same happens in the retry, cancel Batch Execution by following the procedure below.

1.  Open the project.

2.  Click the menu "Migration" -> "Migration Options".

3.  Change the value of "Batch Execution" to "No".

#### Data types CHAR and VARCHAR are changed to NCHAR and NVARCHAR.

##### Cause

MySQL does not support NCHAR or NVARCHAR data types. Instead, it allows for user to specify national character set as an attribute of the CHAR or VARCHAR data type column. The Migration Center converts national character set specified CHAR or VARCHAR column to NCHAR and NVARCHAR column in order to migrate data successfully.

##### Solution

This phenomenon is normal.

###### Note: 

In the default DataType Map of Migration Center, MySQL's NVARCHAR is mapped to NVARCHAR (10666) in Altibase. If the number of bytes per character in the national character set between MySQL and Altibase is different, performing the escalation without consideration of this may cause the schema not to be generated beyond the limit byte count. To avoid this situation, the Migration Center basically fixed the size of the NVARCHAR.

If the data size of the corresponding table column is not large, you can transfer the size of the source database as it is by following the procedure below.

1.  Reconcile step: Click on "NVARCHAR" row in "Data Type Mapping" 
2.  Click the "Change" button 
3.  Select 'NVARCHAR' as Destination DB Data Type, leave Precision blank, and save



### TimesTen

#### When registering connection information, when clicking "Test" button, error message 'Problems with loading native library / missing methods: no ttJdbcCS in java.library.path' is output.

##### Cause

This message shows up when the TimesTen Type 2 JDBC is failed to load the native library.

##### Solution 

Install the TimesTen client package on the machine where you want to run the Migration Center, then rerun the Migration Center. If the target operating system is Linux, users have to add the lib directory path of the client package to LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable after installing the client package.

#### When I click "Test" button while registering connection information, I get error message 'Problems with loading native library / missing method: ~\bin\ttJdbcCS1122.dll: Cannot load AMD 64-bit.dll on a IA 32-bit platrom'.

##### Cause

The error message shows up when incompatible bit-version, 32-bit or 64-bit, between TimesTen client package and the JRE the Migration Center is using.

##### Solution

Open the executable file (migcenter.bat or migcenter.sh) with an editor and change the value of the environment variable JAVA_HOME. Specify the JAVA_HOME path to the JRE that matches the number of bits in the installed TimesTen client package, then rerun the Migration Center.

#### When registering connection information, when clicking "Test" button, error message 'Data source name not found and no default driver specified' is displayed.

##### Cause

This message is output when the DSN value entered in the connection information is invalid.

##### Solution

Enter the DSN registered in the server into the DSN field.
