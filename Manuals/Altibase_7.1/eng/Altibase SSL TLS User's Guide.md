## 1. Introduction to Altibase Hadoop Connector

This chapter describes the concepts and features of Altibase SSL/TLS.

### What is SSL/TLS?

This chapter introduces the basic concepts of Altibase SSL/TLS.

#### Introduction to SSL/TLS Protocols

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the de facto standard network security protocol originally developed by Netscape Communications Corporation. 

SSL 1.0 was not publicly released. A bug-ridden 2.0 was released and followed by a completely redesigned 3.0 in 1996. Afterwards, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) released TLS 1.0, which was an upgrade of 3.0 defined in RFC 2246. For further information about the TLS protocol, please refer to 'RFC-2246 The TLS Protocol (ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2246.txt)’. 

#### Cryptography and Certificates

Symmetric-key algorithms have two or more parties share a single secret key to ensure communication security. This secret key encrypts plaintext and decrypts ciphertext with an efficient algorithm. However, it is difficult for the communicating parties to safely exchange the secret key.

Asymmetric cryptography (also called public-key cryptography) was introduced thereupon. It uses a mathematically linked key pair of one public key and one private key. A message encrypted by a freely accessible public key can only be decrypted by the owner of the matching private key and vice versa.

One party encrypts the secret key with the counterparty’s public key and sends it to the counterparty (the holder of the corresponding private key). The counterparty then decrypts the secret key with its own private key. Afterwards the communicating parties can safely communicate by encrypting and decrypting. 

However, a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can pretend to be both server and client. It is possible that a request for a public key is intercepted and the attacker’s public key is sent, instead of the legitimate one. 

Public key ownership can be verified with a public key certificate (a digital certificate signed by an official certificate authority (CA) trusted by both parties). In an opened-system environment such as the World Wide Web (WWW), it is important to use public certificates for communication security. On the contrary, a private certificate is a certificate generated and signed by a non-official CA. Private certificates are useful in a closed-system environment because they are free to use and can be generated whenever necessary.

### Secure Communication in Altibase

Altibase adopts SSL/TLS using symmetric-key algorithms to encrypt/decrypt data, and asymmetric cryptography to safely exchange the shared key and public/private key pair for authentication.

When a network connection over SSL is initiated, Altibase and its client perform an SSL handshake as below:

1.  The client and server exchange their information (e.g., SSL version, cipher setting and so on) to set up a secure connection environment. 
2.  If server authentication is required, the server sends the client its own certificate and the client verifies server identity with it. 
3.  If the server requests for the client's certificate, the client also sends the server its own certificate and the server verifies client identity with it. 
4.  The client and server exchange key information with public key cryptography and generate a session key to encrypt/decrypt data and validate data integrity. 
5.  The client and server communicate to each other that the future message will be encrypted with the session key and that the handshake is finished.

#### SSL Characteristics in Altibase 

The following list of features are the SSL characterstics when using Altibase with SSL communcation: 

- Altibase uses the TLS 1.0 protocol supported by the OpenSSL library.

- Altibase supports server-only authentication and mutual authentication. 

  * Server-only authentication: Only the server authenticates itself to the client. 
  * Mutual authentication: Both server and client concurrently authenticate themselves to each other

- An additional network port such as port 443 for HTTPS (other than the one that was used) is required to use SSL connections within Altibase. This is because Altibase does not allow a connection switch from non-secure to secure in TCP connections.
  
- To use a secure connection, all client applications need to be implemented with Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) API, which is integrated into Java 1.5 or above. JSSE provides a framework and implementation for a Java version of SSL 2.0, 3.0, and TLS 1.0 protocols as well as data encryption, server authentication, message integrity and optional client authentication. 
  
- Altibase provides the JDBC and ODBC interfaces for SSL connection, which is currently supported only in Intel-Linux.

## 2. Installing and Starting SSL in Altibase

This chapter explains how to install SSL and required software.

### Software Requirements

This section describes the requirements for using SSL communication on the server and client.

#### Server

-   OpenSSL toolkit 0.9.4~1.0.2 
-   Altibase version 6.5.1 or above (only supports Intel-Linux)

The OpenSSL toolkit is a prerequisite for using SSL/TLS in Altibase. The OpenSSL toolkit was developed by the OpenSSL Project and can be downloaded from http://www.openssl.org/source. You should verify that the installed OpenSSL version is not vulnerable to the Heartbleed bug that was disclosed in April 2014. 

The user can use the OPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS option to check whether or not it is infected. 

#### Client

##### ODBC

The OpenSSL toolkit has to be installed in order to use the SSL communication with ODBC.

##### JDBC

It is recommended using Java Runtime Environment 1.6 (JRE1.6) or above to conveniently implement the client Java application through the SSL. JRE 1.6 or above((JRE 1.5 are also available for use) is recommended for the following reason:

-   Only JRE 1.6 or above supports importing the client’s certificate into the keystore (Note that importing the certificate is not always required.).

### Configuring the Environment for SSL

This section discusses how to configure the environment for Altibase SSL.

-   Configure SSL on the Server

-   Configure the Environment for SSL

-   Configrue SSL for ODBC

#### Configure SSL on the Server

-   Step 1: Confirm the Installation of OpenSSL and its Library
-   Step 2: Set Server Properties to Connect over SSL
-   Step 3: Specify SSL Client Authentication
-   Step 4: Set Server Certificate, Private Key, and Certificate Authority
-   Step 5: Start the Server

##### Step 1: Confirm the Installation of OpenSSL and its Library

SSL이 활성화된 Altibase를 설치하기 전에 OpenSSL 툴킷을 설치하는 것이 좋다. 만약
OpenSSL 툴킷이 설치되지 않았는데 Altibase의 SSL을 사용하면,Altibase는 OpenSSL
라이브러리를 찾을 수 없다는 경고 메세지가 나타난다. It is recommnded to install the OpenSSl toolkit before installing SSL-enabled Altibase. Otherwise, if an Altibase function is used and OpenSSL is not installed, Altibase reports that it is unable to find the OpenSSL library.

Verify that OpenSSL is installed on the server and that it is not infected with the Heartbleed bug. If necessary, install it with the package manager provided by the operating system (e.g., RPM, Red Hat Linux) or download it from http://www.openssl.org/source and compile it manually. 

설치가 끝나면, 아래와 같이 설치된 OpenSSL 버전을 확인한다.

```
$ openssl version
OpenSSL 0.9.7e-fips-rhel5 01 Jul 2008
```

##### Step 2: Set Server Properties to Connect over SSL

The following are properties that you need to set to connect over SSL within Altibase. These properties are located in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf file. For more detailed information about these properties, please refer to the *General Reference*.

-   SSL_ENABLE  
    : Switches the SSL feature on or off within Altibase. To enable, set the value to 1. 
-   SSL_PORT_NO  
    : Specifies the listening port number for SSL connections. The value must be unique. 
-   SSL_MAX_LISTEN  
    : Sets the listen queue maximum size for concurrent SSL connections. You should note that more listeners require more memory.
-   SSL_CIPHER_LIST  
    : The candidate cipher algorithm list available for the server and client to use and negotiate with. Depending on your security policy, you can specify one or more cipher names and separate them by colons. You can check the list at OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/) or execute the following command in the shell environment.

```
$ openssl ciphers
```

##### Step 3: Specify SSL Client Authentication

-   SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION  
    : Sets the SSL authentication mode to server-only authentication or mutual authentication. If the user sets the value to 1 for mutual authentication, the server will request a certificate from the client during the SSL handshake.

##### Step 4: Set Server Certificate, Private Key, and Certificate Authority

-   SSL_CERT

-   SSL_KEY

-   SSL_CA

-   SSL_CAPATH

###### SSL_CERT

Sets the server certificate path.

For example, if the name of a server certificate is server-cert.pem and it is located in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/cert directory, the value for this property is ?/cert/server-cert.pem.

###### SSL_KEY

Sets the server private (secret) key path.

For example, if the name of a server’s secret key is server-key.pem and it is located in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/cert directory, the value for this property is ?/cert/server- key.pem.

###### SSL_CA, SSL_CAPATH

The SSL_CA or SSL_CAPATH property must be set in order to receive ownership of the CA certificate issued by an accredited authority. The CA certificate file is located in a user-specified path or a directory in X.509 format.

If you don’t have an accredited certificate, you can use SSL by creating a private certificate. 

##### Step 5: Start the Server

Start SSL-enabled Altibase. Please refer to the sample files provided in the Appendix.

If SSL_ENABLE is set to 1, the SSL listen port is displayed as follows. This means that both the environment variables ALTIBASE_PORT_NO and ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO need to be defined. 

```

#### Configure SSL for JDBC

-   Step 1: Import Certificates

-   Step 2: Set up Authentication in a Java Environment

-   Step 3: Set JDBC Properties for SSL

-   Step 4: Set Altibase Environment Variables

##### Step 1: Import Certificates

The first step is to import certificates into the truststore for the server's CA certificate or into the keystore for its own CA certificate and secret key. Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) uses the truststore and keystore for authentication.

The next step to take depends on whether the CA certificate type is public or private and the job thereafter depends on whether the chosen authentication mode is server-only authentication or mutual authentication.

1.  Private certificates with server-only authentication mode:  
    Import the server's CA certificate into the truststore.

2.  Private certificates with mutual authentication mode:  
    Import the server's CA certificate into the truststore. Import the PKCS #12 formatted file, containing its own CA certificate and secret key, into the keystore.
    
3.  Public certificates with server-only authentication mode:  
    No action is necessary.

4.  Public certificates with mutual authentication mode:  
    Import the PKCS #12 formatted file, containing its own CA certificate and secret key, into the keystore.

When using private certificates (1 or 2 above), import the server's CA certificate into the truststore.

```
$keytool -import -alias alias_name -file server_certificate_file.pem -keystore truststore -storepass password
```

For 2 or 4, prior to importing its certificate and secret key, ensure that the PKCS #12 formatted file, containing its own certificate and secret key, is ready and that the Java version is 1.6 or above. 

If the PKCS #12 file is not ready, execute OpenSSL with the pkcs12 option to generate the PKCS #12 file which contains the client's certificate and secret key as follows.

```
$openssl pkcs12 -export -in client_certificate.pem -inkey client_secretkey_file.pem > pkcs_file.p12
```

Import the prepared PKCS #12 file into the keystore with the following options. <sup>1</sup>

[<sup>1</sup>] You can only import .pem files into keystore with the '-importkeystore' option in Java 6 or above.

```
$keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore pkcs_file.p12 -destkeystore keystore.jks -srcstoretype pkcs12
```

##### Step 2: Set up Authentication in a Java Environment

JRE must access the truststore and keystore for authentication over SSL. The user can select from any of the following three configurations.

-   Configure a Java Application's Command-line Option

-   Use the System.setProperty Method in a Java Application

-   Configure the JDBC Property in a Java Application 

###### Configure a Java Application’s Command-line Option

```
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=path_to_keystore
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=password
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=path_to_truststore
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=password
```

###### Use the System.setProperty Method in a Java Application

```
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStore", "path_to_keystore");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword", "password");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore", "path_to_truststore");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword", "password");
```

###### Configure the JDBC Property in a Java Application

```
Properties sProp = new Properties();
sProps.put("keystore_url", "path_to_keystore");
sProps.put("keystore_password", "password");
sProps.put("truststore_url", "path_to_truststore");
sProps.put("truststore_password", "password");
```

##### Step 3: Set JDBC Properties for SSL

Altibase provides JDBC for SSL connection to use SSL within the database. JDBC properties are categorized into the following two groups:

-   JDBC Properties for SSL Connections

-   JDBC Properties for Authentication

###### JDBC Properties for SSL Connections

| Name             | Description                                                  | Range            | Default Value                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ssl_enable       | Specifies whether or not to connect to the database over SSL connection. An SSL connection is created if this value is true; a TCP connection is created if this value is false. | [true \| false ] | false                                            |
| port             | Specifies the SSL port number on the target server. The priority for an SSL port number is: 1) if ssn_enable is true and a value has been specified, this value is applied first. 2) if ssn_enable is true and this value is omitted, the ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO environment variable is applied. 3) if ssn_enable is true and both this value and the ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO environment variable are omitted, the default value (20300) is applied. | 0 \~ 65535       | ssl_enable(false): 20300 ssl_enable(ture): 20443 |
| ciphersuite_list | This is a list of available ciphers. Each name is separated by a colon (e.g., SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5:SSL _RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA). If JRE does not support the named algorithm, an IllegalArgumentException with the "Unsupported ciphersuite" message is thrown. | String           | All cipher suite lists supported by JRE          |

###### JDBC Properties for Authentication

| Name                      | Description                                                  | Range                      | Default Value |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| verify_server_certificate | Specifies whether or not to authenticate the target server's CA certificate. To use SSL exception authentication, set as false and the client application will not authenticate the server's CA certificate. In this case, it is unnecessary to import the server's private CA certificate for authentication. | [ true \| false ]          | true          |
| keystore_url              | Specifies the path to the keystore (a container for its own private key and the certificates with their corresponding public keys). | String                     | N/A           |
| keystore_type             | Specifies the keystore type for keystore_url. Java Key Store (JKS) is the most common type in Java. | [ JKS, JCEKS, PKCS12, etc] | JKS           |
| keystore_password         | Specifies the password for keystore_url.                     | String                     | N/A           |
| truststore_url            | Specifies the path to the truststore (a keystore containing certificates that belong to the communication partners). | String                     | N/A           |
| truststore_type           | Specifies the truststore type at truststore_url above. Java Key Store (JKS) is the most common type in Java. | [JKS, JCEKS, PKCS12, etc]  | JKS           |
| truststore_password       | Specifies the password to truststore_url above.              | String                     | N/A           |

##### Step 4: Set Altibase Environment Variables

Altibase sets the port number for SSL communication, and this step can be omitted. 

If the port property has not been set for JDBC, the value specified for ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO will be used as the port number. If ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO is omitted, the default value for the port property is used. 

| Name                 | Description                                         | Value                | Default Value |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO | Specifies the SSL port number on the target server. | Range: 1024 \~ 65535 | N/A           |

##### Considerations When Using SSL with JDBC

Please consider the following when using SSL for JDBC.

###### Importing the PKCS #12 File into the Keystore (Available for JRE 1.6. or Above)

To use mutual authentication over SSL, you must first import the client's CA certificate and private key into the KeyStore. At this time, the supported version is JRE1.6 or higher. This is because, in Java 6 or higher, you can use the importkeystore option to send a pem file to the keystore.

However, after importing PKCS only once in JRE1.6 or later, JRE1.5 can be used. In other words, only the import process requires JRE1.6, and the mutual authentication function itself also works in 1.5.

```
$keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore pkcs_file.p12 -destkeystore keystore.jks
-srcstoretype pkcs12
```

#### Configure SSL for ODBC

-   Step 1: Verify the OpenSSL Library

-   Step 2: Prepare the Client’s Certificate

-   Step 3:  Set ODBC/CLI Properties for SSL

-   Step 4: Write a Client Program

##### Step 1: Verify the OpenSSL Library

You need the OpenSSL library to use SSL in ODBC. ODBC reads the OpenSSL library and calls the necessary functions while connecting to the server. Therefore, you should verify that the OpenSSL library has been installed properly, before writing a client application. Where the library is installed can differ among operating systems.

-   Verify the library installation

```
$ ls -al /usr/lib/libssl*
$ ls -al /usr/lib/libcrypto*
```

-   Verify the utility installation

```
$ openssl version
```

##### Step 2: Prepare the Client’s Certificate

Prepare the client’s certificate and secret key in a pem format file for mutual authentication of the server and client. The location of these files should be accessible by a client using ODBC.

##### Step 3: Set ODBC/CLI Properties for SSL

You need to set SSL properties appropriately, before writing a client program using SSL. The client can specify the following properties as a connection string when connecting to the server. Refer to the sample program for usage.

SSL connection properties are located in $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf. 

| Name       | Description                                                  | Range        | Default Value |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| SSL_CA     | Specifies the file path to store CA certificates to certify the ownership of received certificates. CA certificates can exist in a user-specific file path or a X.509 structured directory. <br/>Ex)SSL_CA= /cert/ ca-cert.pem. | 없음         | NULL          |
| SSL_CAPATH | Specifies CAPATH in a CA directory format. <br/>Ex) SSL_CAPATH=/etc/ssl/certs | 없음         | NULL          |
| SSL_CERT   | Sets the Altibase certificate path. </br>Ex)SSL_CERT=/cert/client-cert.pe m | 없음         | NULL          |
| SSL_KEY    | Sets the server private (secret) key path. <br/>Ex) SSL_KEY=/cert/client-key.pem | 없음         | NULL          |
| SSL_VERIFY | Sets whether or not to authenticate the server certificate.

##### Step 4: Write a Client Program

Write a program to use SSL connection in the client application. You can find a sample program that uses SSL connection in the altibase directory. Please refer to $ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/SQLCLI/SSL.

## 3. Managing SSL Connections

### Managing SSL Connections

This section describes how to enhance security using the SSL exclusive connection feature, and monitor or manage SSL connections.

-    Limit TCP Connections

-   Monitor and Manage SSl Connections

#### Limit TCP Connections

The main reason to use SSL is to guarantee secure communication between the client and the server. In SSL-enabled Altibase, remote users are, by default, allowed to access the database over SSL, as well as TCP. Tightened security may require stricter access control of each database user.

The SYS user can control each user's access to the database only via SSL connection by disabling TCP connection as follows. 

-   User's TCP connection limit

```
ALTER USER user_name [ENABLE | DISABLE] TCP
CREATE USER user_name IDENTIFIED BY password [ENABLE | DISABLE] TCP
```

Permission of TCP connection for database users can be checked by issuing the SELECT query on the DISABLE_TCP column in the SYSTEM_.SYS_USERS_ meta table. 

```
SELECT * FROM SYSTEM_.SYS_USERS_
```

##### Examples

\<Query\> Create a user who is not allowed to connect via TCP

```
iSQL> CREATE USER user1 IDENTIFIED BY user1 DISABLE TCP;
Create success.
```

\<Query\> Verify that the user is not allowed to connect via TCP.

```
iSQL> SELECT user_name, disable_tcp FROM SYSTEM_.SYS_USERS_;
USER_NAME                                 DISABLE_TCP
----------------------------------------------------------
SYSTEM_                                   F
SYS                                       F
USER1                                     T
3 rows selected.
```

\<Query\> After changing so that an unauthorized user can connect to TCP,
check the meta table to see if the access rights have been changed.

```
iSQL> ALTER USER user1 ENABLE TCP;
Alter success.
iSQL> SELECT user_name, disable_tcp FROM SYSTEM_.SYS_USERS_;
USER_NAME                                 DISABLE_TCP
----------------------------------------------------------
SYSTEM_                                   F
SYS                                       F
USER1                                     F
3 rows selected.
```

#### Monitor and Manage SSL Connections

Monitoring active database connections is important to detect illegal access to the database.

The V$SESSION performance view provides detailed information on database connections such as the connected client, connection properties, and so on. In particular, the COMM_NAME column describes the type of protocol, the client's address, and connected port number. For more detailed information about performance views, please refer to the *General Reference*.

```
iSQL> SELECT id, db_username, comm_name  FROM V$SESSION WHERE comm_name like 'SSL%';
ID          DB_USERNAME
---------------------------------------------------------
COMM_NAME
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1           USER1
SSL 127.0.0.1:40328
1 row selected.
```

Once illegal access to the database is detected, the database administrator may need to forcefully terminate it. This can be done in the following steps.

-   Log into the database in iSQL as the SYS user in SYSDBA mode and issue a query to disconnect the target session in iSQL.

```
$isql -s localhost -u user_name -p password -SYSDBA
iSQL> ALTER DATABASE database_name SESSION CLOSE session_number
```

-   Ensure that the target session is disconnected by issuing a connection monitoring query. 

```
iSQL> SELECT * FROM V$SESSION WHERE ID = session_id
```

SYSDBA is a special privilege for the SYS user to perform administrative jobs. Logging into the database with the SYS account in SYSDBA mode can be done in iSQL by inputting the -SYSDBA option when starting iSQL or using the CONNECT command with the AS SYSDBA option.

```
$ isql -s localhost -u sys -p manager -sysdba

## Appendix A: SSL Sample

Altibase provides a sample file in which the server and client use SSL connection.

Signed CA certificates, two pairs of certificates, secret key, sample java source code and more are available in $ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/cert.

The sample program that uses SSL can be found in the altibase directry in $ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/ .
