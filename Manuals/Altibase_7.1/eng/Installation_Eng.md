1. About the Altibase Package Installer
------------------------

This Altibase Package Installer is a Java-based installer that lets you easily install Altibase products such as the database server, client components, tools, and so forth.

### Altibase Home

When you install Altibase with the Altibase Package Installer, a home directory and APatch directory are generated.

The Altibase home directory is the default directory wherein Altibase software is installed.

#### Altibase Home Directory

When you install Altibase with the Altibase Package Installer, a home directory (wherein Altibase products are installed) is generated. The Altibase home directory takes the following values by default

-   When installing Altibase Server Products:

```
$HOME/altibase-server-<version>
```

-   When installing Altibase Client Products:

```
$HOME/altibase-client-<version>
```

### APatch Directory

Information about Altibase products that were installed with the Altibase Package Installer is stored in the APatch directory, under the Altibase home directory.

#### Structure and Contents of the APatch Directory

APatch is the name of the Altibase Package Installer directory and is located in the Altibase home directory

This directory contains files that store information about an installed product or a patch version:

-   patchinfo file

-   pkg_patch_\<version\>.txt file

-   altibase_base_install.log file

-   Backup directory

#### patchinfo File

This file contains:

- Information about the base release [<sup>1</sup>] version and the patch of the currently installed Altibase product.
  
- Information about the environment (such as the OS, OS patch, C/C++ compiler, and Java compiler are built)

Example)

```
PRODUCT_SIGNATURE=server-7.1.0-64-release
PATCH_VERSION=0_0_0_0

=======  OS INFO  =======
Linux rhel6-x64 2.6.32-71.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Sep 1 01:33:01 EDT 2010 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
=======  PATCH INFO  =======
2.6.32-71.el6.x86_64
=======  COMPILER INFO  =======
gcc version 4.6.3 (GCC)
glibc 2.12
=======  JAVA INFO  =======
java version "1.5.0_22"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_22-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 1.5.0_22-b03, mixed mode)
```

#### pkg_patch_x_x_x_x.txt File

This file is automatically generated as pkg_patch_<patch_version>.txt whenever a product is patched. This file contains the revision number of the source code modified to create the patch.

The following example shows the contents of the Patch directory after installing the base release 7.1.0.0.0:

```
$ ls
pkg_patch_0_0_0_0.txt
```

The following example shows the contents of the APatch directory after installing the patch 7.1.0.0.10:

```
$ls
pkg_patch_0_0_0_0.txt  pkg_patch_0_0_0_10.txt

$cat pkg_patch_0_0_0_10.txt
Repository: /altidev4/tags/altibase_7_1_0_0_10_tag/
Revision: xxxxx
Last Changed Rev: xxxxx
```

#### altibase_base_install.log file

All operations during the most recent installation are written to this file.

#### Backup Directory

When installing a new patch, the Altibase Package Installer creates backups of the patched files to which the patch is applied and stored it in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/APatch directory. Within this directory, these are seperated backup directories generated for each patch. These backup files are used to roll back the patch in the future.

In addition, executable files that are used to uninstall or rollback patches are installed in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/APatch directory when a product is installed or patched.

> \* Caution1: HP platforms do not support automatic backups or rollbacks if the Package Installer is patched. Data and log files must be manually backup. 

> \* Caution2: Only files that are installed with the Package Installer are backedup to this backup directory; files that are generated after the product has been installed (such as data files and log files) are not backed up.

The following example shows the contents of the APatch directory, after installing the base release 7.1.0.0.0:

```
altibase_base_install.log  patchinfo
pkg_patch_0_0_0_0.txt	      uninstall-base
```

The following example shows the contents of the APatch directory, after installing the patch 7.1.0.0.10:

```
altibase_base_install.log   pkg_patch_0_0_0_10.txt
uninstall-p0_0_0_10           patchinfo
rollback-p0_0_0_10/           pkg_patch_0_0_0_0.txt
uninstall-base
```

-   uninstall-base: the executable file needed to uninstall the base release 7.1.0.0.0.
-   rollback-p0_0_0_10: the directory that contains backups of the files patched with 7.1.0.0.10.
-   uninstall-p0_0_0_10: the executable file needed to delete the patch 7.1.0.0.10 and rollback to the previous version. These files are stored in the rollback-p0_0_0_10 directory.

#### Check the Environment Before Installation

The Altibase Package Installer checks the environment before installing the product to see if the environment of the installed equipment meets the requirements for a successful installation. This process is performed without a graphical user interface (GUI).

During this operation, the Altibase Package Installer checks the following information about the server: 

-   The operating system name and version

-   The operating system mode (64-bit)

If you have downloaded an Altibase Package Installer that does not match your operating system, an error message is returned and the installation will be aborted. Finding problems with the system configuration in the previous step reduces the likelihood of encountering problems during installation.

#### Download the Package Installer

You can download the appropriate Package Installer for your operating system from Altibase's Customer Support site (support.altibase.com/en/).

For more detailed information about supported operating system, please refer to  "[Download the Altibase Package Installer](#download-the-altibase-package-installer).

#### Set the Installation Mode

The Altibase Package Installer runs in one of the following modes:

-   Interactive Command-line Mode: if the DISPLAY environment variable has not been set.
-   Graphic User Interface (GUI) <pde: If the DISPLAY environment variable has been set.

This manual assumes that the Altbiase Package Installer's installation mode is set to GUI.

##### Set GUI Mode

Users can run the Altibase Package Installer in GUI mode by setting the DISPLAY environment variable on the host computer as follows: 

```
$ setenv DISPLAY <machine name>:0.0
```

\<machine_name\> is the IP address or host name of the computer that is to display the Altibase Package Installer process. Use the serene command for Shell or set export DISPLAY=\<machine name\>:0.0 for Korn Shell.

If you want to allow the Altibase Package Installer to run in GUI mode at a remote location other than the host computer, run the following command on the remote computer: 

```
$ xhost +
```

#### Start the Altibase Package Installer

To run the Altibase Package Installerm a suer needs to download the Package Installer and then change file permissions, using chmod.

```
$ chmod +x altibase-server-7.1.0.0.0-LINUX-X86-64bit-release.run
```

Run the Altibase Package Installer

```
$./altibase-server-7.1.0.0.0-LINUX-X86-64bit-release.run
```

If the Package Installer is set to GUI mode, the following Setup wizard appears:

![](media/Installation/da9973bd8595388a63a8cb5bdc861118.png)

#### Enter the Installation Directory and Select the Installation Type

In the following installlation directory panel below, select the Altibase hom directory, the directory where Altibase will be installed, and the package installation type: 

![](media/Installation/4590cc03f9412e29d691b5733f309f6e.png)

To install an Altibase product, click "Full Installation" in the Installation Type list: to install a patch for a previously installed version, click "Patch Installtion" in the Installation Type list.

If Altibase product has already been installed to the specified directory, a warning message appears. In this case, enter another directory or uninstall the product installed in the specified directory first.

![](media/Installation/3cb1b47a6d6a3dffd96b854469871644.png)

#### Check System Parameters

The following dialog box displays the necessary system kernel parameters and how to set them. System kernel parameters must be set using the root account. Some systems need to be rebooted after kernel parameters have been set.

Kernel parameters should be manually set before proceeding to the next step. To set them after installation is complete, please refer to the \$ALTIBASE_HOME/install/pre_install.sh file.

![](media/Installation/fc2a996b31a60f8bf22b1e67d667c030.png)

To ensure that Altibase runs properly, you should configure your system environment first. To do so, you must modify kernel parameter values using root privileges before installing Altibase. Kernel parameter values may be modified after installation; however, they must be set before running Altibase. The following is an example of showing the recommended values of system kernel parameters for each OS. For more detailed information on OS-specific kernel parameters, please refer to *[Installation Prerequisites*](#installation-prerequisites).

#### Install the Altibase Product

![](media/Installation/6e4149c8cebcfc9c18603070855832ef.png)

When the installation is completed, the Package Installer performs the following operations without GUI:

-   The properties set are updated in the altibase.properties files.

-   The altibase_user.env.file containing the basic environment for running the Altibase server is created in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf directory. The command to run this file is then added to the user account's configuration file (such as .bashrc or .bash_profile or .profile).

The following are examples of the altibase_user.env file and the .bash_profile file. 

```
### altibase_user.env
ALTIBASE_HOME=/home/hdb71_p/pkg_test/altibase-server-7.1;export ALTIBASE_HOME 
PATH=${ALTIBASE_HOME}/bin:${PATH};export PATH 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${ALTIBASE_HOME}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH};ex port LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
CLASSPATH=${ALTIBASE_HOME}/lib/Altibase.jar:${CLASSPATH};e xport CLASSPATH 

### .bash_profile 
# ALTIBASE_ENV 
. /home/hdb71_p/pkg_test/altibase-server-7.1/conf/altibase_user.env
```

#### Register or Update the Altibase License Key

The following dialog box is where you register your Altibase license key. You can register the license key with the Altibase Package Installer by either: 

-   Entering the license key directly

-   Selecting a file containing license key information

-   Postponing license registration: If you have no obtained the license key yet, then you can copy a new license file to the $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf directory after you have obtained one. However, if you do not enter the license key at this step, the Package Installer does not ask whether or not to create a database at the next step.

```
$ cp license $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf/
```

![](media/Installation/d68302cf8f9ada6fd563be03e9f5ffd1.png)

#### Preview the Altibase Quick Settings Guide

The "Altibase Quick Setting Guide" dialog box shows you how to start Altibase after it has been installed successfully. 

The Altibase Package Installer provides the following two shell scripts to help users configure system kernel parameters and environment variables easier.

-   \$ALTIBASE_HOME/install/pre_install.sh  
    This script contains the minimum set of essential system kernel parameters, their recommended values, and explain how to set them
    
-   \$ALTIBASE_HOME/install/post_install.sh  
    This script contains a SQL script for creating a new database (if step 2 was performed for Set Altibase Properties).
    
-   \$ALTIBASE_HOME/packages/catproc.sql  
    This script contains a SQL script for using PSM.

If you select the checkbox in the next panel, the Altibase Package Installer will create a new database and run a script to use PSM, which will take a bit longer to install. If you do not select the checkbox, you must manually create the new database and run the PSM script after installation.

![](media/Installation/1a8e37e6dcd41953d2f266889642d3d0.png)

    Altibase services will not start.
    In this case, please visit http://support.altibase.com.
    

3. Configure user environment variables (using the user account with 
which Altibase was installed).
    Run the '/home/hdb71_p/pkg_test/altibase-server-7.1/install/post_install.sh' file 
    under the account with which Altibase was installed.

    This script performs necessary post-installation configuration. 

    1) Create the Altibase user environment file and apply it to the user profile.
         (/home/hdb71_p/pkg_test/altibase-server-7.1/conf/altibase_user.env)
    2) Create a database.

         If you selected 'YES' in response to the question about whether to create 
         a database after installation, at "Altibase Property setting step 1", 
         a database will be automatically created.

         If you selected 'NO' in response to this question,
         you need to create a database manually.

         shell> server create [DB Character Set] [National Character Set]

4. Start up and shut down the server
    shell> server start
    shell> server stop

5. Runs all scripts required for or used with PSM
Run the '/home/hdb71_p/pkg_test/altibase-server-7.1/packages/catproc.sql' file.

6. Connect to the database using iSQL
    shell> isql -s 127.0.0.1 -u SYS -p MANAGER
```


The following message appears while a database is being created.

3. Uninstalling Altibase and Meta Downgrade
----------------------------------

This chapter explains how to uninstall an installed or meta downgrade the installed product.

-   Altibase Product Uninstallation

-   Meta Downgrade

### Uninstalling Altibase Products

Altibase products can be uninstalled or rolled back using the Uninstaller which is installed with the product. Target files for rollback are only for files that have been patched by the installer, and data files and log files are not included. The Uninstaller associated with a base release (a full package used for initial installation) uninstalls the entire product; the Uninstaller which is installed when a patch is applied can be used either to uninstall the entire product or to roll back the corresponding patch.

> \* Note: On the HP-UX platform, the Uninstaller provided with the Altibase Package Installer can only uninstall the entire product; it cannot rollback patches. Therefore, it is recommended to manually back up the previously installed product before applying a patch.

#### Full Uninstallation

Altibase Products or patches which are installed by the Altibase Package Installer can be uninstalled with the Uninstaller that is provided with the product to be removed.

However, the Uninstaller cannot delete the environment variable. Therefore, the user must manually delete Altibase-related environment variables from the account's environment variable file. To remove Altibase products, perform the following steps:

1.  Select the Uninstaller (e.g., uninstall-base) associated with the product to be removed from the $ALTIBASE_HOME/APatch directory.
    
2.  Run the Uninstaller.

#### Patch Uninstallation

Patches installed using the Altibase Package Installer can be rolled back by running the Uninstaller named according to the convention "uninstall-p<patch_version>". However, only the most recently installed patch can be rolled back. During uninstallation, a patch is removed and the previous version is restored from the backup.

To roll back a patch, perform the following steps:

1.  Select the Uninstaller (e.g., uninstall-p0_0_0_1) associated with the patch to be removed from the $ALTIBASE_HOME/APatch directory
    
2.  Run the Uninstaller.

### Meta Downgrade

This section describes the meta downgrade to roll back other Altibase patches that are meta version.

Altibase requires that the current meta version and meta version of the package user wants to down patch have to match in order to roll back the patch. If the meta version is different when deleting or rolling back the patch, the user must first reconfigure the current version of meta to the old version of the meta. This process is called meta downgrade.

#### How to Use Meta Downgrade

##### Version Check

The current and previous meta version can be checked in SYSTEM_.SYM_DATABASE .

The current meta version can be checked by the META_VER, META_MINOR_VER, and META_PATCH_VER columns.

The previous meta version can be checked by PREV_META_MAJOR_VER, PREV_META_MINOR_VER, and PREV_META_PATCH_VER columns.

In order to meta downgrade, the version has to be checked and verified that the version of META_MINOR_VER and PREV_META_MINOR_VER are different as shown below:

```
iSQL> SELECT META_MAJOR_VER, META_MINOR_VER, META_PATCH_VER,
 PREV_META_MAJOR_VER, PREV_META_MINOR_VER, PREV_META_PATCH_VER
 FROM SYSTEM_.SYS_DATABASE_;
META_MAJOR_VER META_MINOR_VER META_PATCH_VER 
-------------------------------------------------
PREV_META_MAJOR_VER PREV_META_MINOR_VER PREV_META_PATCH_VER 
----------------------------------------------------------------
8           5           1          
8           4           1          
1 row selected.
```

##### Meta Downgrade

For meta downgrade-able version, perform the meta downgrade with the following syntax: 

```
$ server downgrade
```

> \* Note: User must shut down the server (server stop) before performing the meta downgrade. If the user does perform this without shutting down the server, then the following error with occur: 

```
$ server downgrade
 server is running !!!!
 you must shutdown first before server downgrade
$ server downgrade
...
...
...ISQL_CONNECTION = UNIX, SERVER = localhost
[ERR-910FB : Connected to idle instance]

TRANSITION TO PHASE : PROCESS
 
TRANSITION TO PHASE : CONTROL

```

If the meta downgrade fails, it ends as follows: 

```
$ server downgrade
...
...
...
TRANSITION TO PHASE : DOWNGRADE

[ERR-91015 : Communication failure.]
```

> ###### Note
>
> If the meta downgrade fails, the user can check the cause of the failure in the altibase.boot.log and altibase.qp.log in $ALTIBASE_HOME/trc directory.

##### Uninstalling Patch

Run the Patch Uninstaller to remove the patch

> ###### Note
>
> After performing a server downgrade, the user must delete the patch. If the server is run without deleting the patch, the meta upgrade will occur because the meta version has been modified to the previous version. 

4. Patching Products With the Altibase Package Installer
----------------------------------

This chapter consists of the following sections:

-   About Patches

-   Patching Altibase Server Products

-   Patching Altibase Client Products

### About Patches

A patch is a small collection of files that is used to overwrite an existing installation. Patches are associated with particular versions of Altibase Products. Patches are bug fixes that are made available to users in response to specific bugs. They require a particular base release or patch set to be installed before being applied.

### Patching Altibase Client Products

This section describes how to apply Altibase client patches

#### Checking the Environment Before Installation

Please refer to [Checking the Environment Before Installation](#checking-the-environment-before-installation).

#### Downloading the Altibase Package Installer

Altibase does not offer a separate installation file for patches. When users start the Package Installer, users can select the installation type - either the "Full Installation" or "Patch". Download the appropriate installer for your operating system from Altibase's Customer Support site (http://support.altibase.com/en/)

#### Setting the Installation Mode

To install the Package Installer in GUI mode, please refer to [Set the Installation Mode](#set-the-installation-mode).

#### Starting the Altibase Package Installer

To run the Altibase Package Installer, Unix users must download the Package Installer, and then change the permissions of the file, using chmod.

```
$ chmod +x altibase-client-7.1.0.0.1-LINUX-X86-64bit-release.run
```

Run the Altibase Package Installer

```
$./altibase-client-7.1.0.0.1-LINUX-X86-64bit-release.run
```

If the installation mode is set to GUI mode, the following Start panel is displayed.

#### Entering the Installation Directory and Selecting the Installation Type

In the Installation Directory panel, enter the Altibase home directory where the patch version will be applied, and select the installation type as "Patch".

The base release must be installed before applying the patch. If the Altibase product is not installed in the directory users specified, a dialog box appears with a warning message. However, if users select "Full Installation" for the installation type, the installation steps are identical to those for Altibase Client Products. Please refer to [Installing Altibase Client Products](#installing-altibase-client-products).

## Appendix A. Installation Prerequisites

### Setting User Resource Limit Values

User resource limit values can be confirmed or changed with the OS command, "ulimit".

-   File Size  
    The maximum file size treatable by the process

-   Data Segment Size  
    The maximum size of logical memory the process can use (vsz field).

-   Max Memory Size  
    The maximum size of physical memory the process can use (RSS field)

-   Open Files (descriptor)  
    The Maximum number of files and sockets simultaneously accessible by the process.

-   Stack size
    The maximum size of the stack

-   Virtual memory  
    The maximum size of virtual memory usable by the process. 

Unix users are recommended to set the resource limit values of a user's account to "unlimited" (caution is required that the core file size is not set to "unlimited"). If the Altibase server crashes and dumps the core, it will store every memory database as a core file, so setting it to unlimited may cause disk shortage. Altibase client products must have a stack size of at least 70KB.

### Setting Kernel Parameters for Different Operating Systems (OS)

System Kernel parameter values can be confirmed or changed with a utility provided for each operating system. 

System kernel parameters can be classified into the following: 

-   Semaphore  
    Semaphore setting for IPC connection

-   File-cache  
    Settings for the prevention of memory insufficiency due to the operating system's file cache.

-   Other Settings

#### HP-UX

##### Setting Kernel Parameters on HP-UX

-   HP 11.31 or above: Kernel parameters can be set with the /usr/sbin/kcture utility.

#### AIX

##### 설정 방법

Kernel parameters can be set with the /usr/bin/smit utility

##### Recommended Values

The same values for shared memory and semaphore on HP-UX are also recommended for AIX.

###### Setting File-Cache

Depending on the file caching policy for AIX, the file system can swap-out memory from the application program heap, although the system has free memory, and use it as file-cache (this is called stealing).

For AIX 5.2 or higher, kernel parameters can be set as below to prevent the system from stealing: 

```
minperm =  5%
lru_file_repage = 0 (AIX 5.2 ML4 or higher)
strict_maxclient = 0
```

###### Posix AIO의 설정

AIX provides the Posix A/O interfaces for improved disk I/O improvement which must be manually activated. However, from AIX 6.1 and higher, the interfaces are activated by default.

Posix AIO can be activated as below:

-   Change "Configure Defined Asynchronous I/O" to Available through smit. 

-   Change "STATE to be configured at system restarted" to Available through smit. 

This Installation and startup of Altibase are impossible on AIX if the system is not set as above. 

#### LINUX

##### Setting Kernel Parameters on Linux

Kernel parameters can be set in the sem,shmmax, shmmni, swapiness files at the /proc/sys/kernel path. In Redhat 7.2 and later versions check the value of RemoveIPC in /etc/system/login.conf . 

##### Recommended Values

The same values for shared memory and semaphore on HP-UX are also recommended for Linux

However, sessions using the IPC connection can be abruptly cut off, if the Linux kernel version is lower than 2.5. 

To set kernel parameters automatically when the server boots, add the following to the /etc/rc.d/rc/local file. 

```
/etc/rc.d/rc.local Add the following entry in the file.
echo 2147483648 > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
echo 4096 > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmni
echo 200 32000 512 5029 > /proc/sys/kernel/sem
echo 5 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
```

###### Setting in RemoveIPC

In RedHat 7.2 and later versions, it is recommended to set the RemoveIPC setting to 'no' (default is 'yes'). If RemoveIPC is set to 'yes', there is a shortage of semaphores and an abnormal termination may occur.

To change the setting, you need to set the RemoveIPC = no in etc/system/logind.conf and restart the OS. 

### Configuration of THP (Transparent Huge Pages)

THP is amemory management system provided by a Linux and its main purpose is to reduce the expenses for viewing TBL (Translation Lookaside Buffer) by increasing the size of memory pages.

However, unlike the original intention, THP causes memory allocation delay and fragmentation which eventually deteriorates the performance in most cases. Thus, THP option should be deactivated in order to use Altibase with its optimized performance. 

It is advised to set the THP option to 'never' in order to run the Altibase operation.

#### Verification method for THP configuration

The available options of THP are always, madvise, and never. Besides, the option inside the square brackets [] is the option currently applied.

-   madvise: This is an option in which THP is activated on a process explicitly requested through the madvise()function.
    
-   always: THP is always applied into all process

-   never: means deactivating THP on all process regardless of requesting  the madvise()function

How to verify for THP Configuration are follows: 

1. Execute the following command indicated below: 

   ```
   $ cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
   ```

2. Execute the following command in RedHat Linux:

   ```
   $ cat /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled
   ```

3. Then, the following output is displayed: 

   ```
   $ [always] madvise never
   ```

#### Deactivation method for THP

It is advised to set the HTP option to never in order to run the Altibase operation.

1. Add transparent_hugepage=never to the end of the line kernel boot of /etc/grub.conf with the root account.
   
```
   .....
   kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.32-220.el6.x86_64 ro root=UUID=067b9803-90ca-4875-a018-ff043adde1ed rd_NO_LUKS LANG=ko_KR.UTF-8 rd_NO_MD quiet rhgb crashkernel=128M  KEYBOARDTYPE=pc KEYTABLE=us rd_NO_LVM rd_NO_DM transparent_hugepage=never
   ......
   ```
   
2. Reboot the system.

3. Confirm whether the THP option is never or not. 

### Checking Disk Configuration

Redo log files and data files generally experience disk I/O in Altibase. To minimize performance loss due to disk I/O, we recommend that you segregate redo log files and data files onto a separate physical disk.

### OS Patch

#### Linux
There is a bug in glibc that could cause deadlock due to race conditions such as malloc/free, and it must be patched beyond the patch taht reflects the bug. In this case, it is recommended to be glib patched with glibc-2.12-1.166.el6_7.1 and/or higher version. (Reference: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1244002)

#### AIX

 When using Altibase on AIX, memory usage increases (hearpmin library bug). In this case, C/C++ compilers of the appropriate version must be patched from the IBM Support Portal (http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21110831 ).
