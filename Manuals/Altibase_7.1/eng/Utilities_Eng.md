## 1. aexport

### Introducing aexport

#### Overview

aexport supports automated data migration between Altibases. This utility stores logical structures and data in text format, and automatically creates a script to load the stored text data into a new database. 

The objects and components that aexport can extract from a database to which it is connected are database users, user privileges, tables, tablespaces, table constraints, indexes, views, materialized views, stored procedures, sequences, and replication objects. 

Because aexport creates SQL scripts corresponding to logical structures in the database and downloads all data in text form, it can migrate data between databases of different versions or platforms. This utility should be used when the database is running, but not actively providing service (when clients are not connected).

#### aexport Features

aexport can extract the following database objects and structural elements:

-   Database users
-   User privileges 
-   Roles 
-   Tablespaces 
-   Tables 
-   Table constraints 
-   Indexes 
-   Views 
-   Materialized views 
-   Stored procedures 
-   Replication objects

In order to execute, aexport generates the SQL scripts to create the database components listed above and the shell scripts to run them.

##### aexport Modes and Script Files

aexport can be executed in different modes to extract different portions of the database. The desired mode can be specified on the command-line.

The aexport execution mode and the SQL script files generated for each mode are described in the section below.

##### Full DB Mode

Full DB mode extracts the entire database and is only available for the SYS user.

The following SQL script files are generated for this mode:

-   SYS_CRT_DIR.sql: Creates all directory objects.

-   SYS_CRT_USER.sql: Creates all users and roles.

-   SYS_CRT_SYNONYM.sql: Create all synonym objects.

-   SYS_CRT_REP.sql: Create all replicaiton objects.

-   ALL_CRT_VIEW_PROC.sql: Creates all views and stored procedures.

-   ALL_CRT_TBS.sql: Creates all tablespaces.

-   ALL_CRT_TBL.sql: Creates all user tables.

-   ALL_CRT_INDEX.sql: Creates all user indexes.

-   ALL_CRT_FK.sql:  Creates all user-defined foreign keys.

-   ALL_CRT_TRIG.sql: Creates all user-defined triggers.

-   ALL_CRT_SEQ.sql: Creates all user-defined sequences.

-   ALL_CRT_LINK.sql: Creates all user-defined database link objects.

-   ALL_EXE_STATS.sql: Creates statistics for all user-defined tables, columns, and indexes.

-   ALL_REFRESH_MVIEW.sql: Refreshes all user materialized views.

-   ALL_ALT_TBL.sql :  Switches the data access mode for tables and partitions of all users.

> Note: 
>
> A role can only be extracted in full DB mode, because it is a non-schema object.

##### User Mode

This mode exports all objects owned by a specified user and is available only for the SYS user or the user whose objects are to be exported. Set the -u command-line option to the desired user for this mode.

The following SQL script files are generated for this mode:

-   {User name}_CRT_TBL.sql: Creates all tables of the specified user.

-   {User name}_CRT_INDEX.sql: Creates all indexes of the specified user.

-   {User name}_CRT_FK.sql: Creates all foreign keys of the specified user.

-   {User name}_CRT_TRIG.sql: Creates all triggers of the specified user.

-   {User name}_CRT_SEQ.sql: Creates all sequences of the specified user.

-   {User name}_CRT_LINK.sql: Creates all database link objects of the specified user

-   {User name}_EXE_STATS.sql: Creates statistics for all tables, columns and indexes of specified user

-   {User name}_REFRESH_MVIEW.sql: Refreshes all materialized views of the specified user.

-   {User name}_ALT_TBL.sql : Switches the data access mode for tables and partitions of the specified user.

##### Object Mode

Object mode exports a specified set of objects (user.object) and is available only for the SYS user or the user whose objects are to be exported. Use the -object command-line option for this mode.

All specified objects must belong to the same user; however, the SYS user can export any user object. 

The following SQL script files are generated for this mode

-   {User name}_{Object name}_CRT.sql: Creates the specified user object.

-   {User name}_{Object name}_STATS.sql: Creates the specified user statistics.

#####  Shell Script Files

In addition to the above SQL scripts, the following shell script files are also created when aexport is executed:

-   run_il_in.sh: Loads data.

-   run_il_out.sh: Downloads data.

-   run_is.sh: Creates schema.

-   run_is_con.sh: Creates constraints. This script includes SQL scripts for creating indexes, foreign keys, triggers, and replication objects. This script is created if the TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT property is set to ON.

-   run_is_fk.sh: Creates foreign keys and triggers. This script is not created if the TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT property is set to ON.

-   run_is_index.sh: Creates indexes. This script is not created if the TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT property is set to ON.

-   run_is_repl.sh: Creates replication objects. This script is not created if the TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT property is set to ON.

-   run_is_refresh_mview.sh:  Refreshes materialized views. This script is not created if the TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT property is set to ON.

-   run_is_alt_tbl.sh : Switches the data access mode of tables and partitions. This script is not created if the TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT property is set to ON.

When one of the above shell script files is executed on the destination database, the logical structure of the source database is created on the destination database. Additionally, all data that exists on the source database is loaded into the destination database. These shell script files use iLoader to download and upload data; the iLoader process is automated within the shell script.

All files generated by aexport are text files, so the user can modify them as desired.

-   ##### aexport Properties and Script Files
  
    This section discusses script files generated by aexport properties.
    
    Please refer to aexport Properties for more information.
    
    -   INVALID_SCRIPT = ON,INVALID.sql is generated. This script file contains SQL scripts for all invalid views and stored procedures. A shell script file for executing INVALID.sql is not generated.
    
    -   TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT = OON, ALL_OBJECT.sql is generated for all objects and ALL_OBJECT_CONSTRAINTS.sql for all indexes, foreign keys, triggers, and replication objects. The run_is_con.sh shell script file for executing ALL_OBJECT_CONSTRAINTS.sql is also generated.

#### Setting aexport

aexport requires the following information to connect to a server:

-   ALTIBASE_HOME  
    The path where the server or client is installed.

-   server_name  
    The name or IP address of the computer hosting the database from which data is to be downloaded.

-   port_no  
    The port number to be used to connect over TCP or IPC.

-   user_id  
    The database user identifier used by aexport to connect to the database.

-   Password  
    The password for the database user identifier.

-   NLS_USE  
    The character set in which to display data.

The path where the server or client is installed can only be set with the ALTIBASE_HOME environment variable. The rest can be set with command-line options. For more detailed information about command-line options, please refer to "How to Use aexport". 

The ALTIBASE_HOME environment variable must be correctly set, and the aexport property settings file (aexport.properties) must exist and be properly configured for aexport to run successfully. For more detailed information about the aexport.properties file, please refer to "aexport Properties".

ALTIBASE_HOME is usually set automatically when the server is installed. For the client, the user must set it manually. If it is not set, it may not work properly, so it is recommended to check whether it is set correctly before executing.

port_no and NLS_USE can be set with environment variables or the altibase.properties file. If set in more than one way, the following methods take precedence in descending order.

1.  Command-line options

2.  Environment variables (ALTIBASE_PORT_NO, ALTIBASE_NLS_USE)

3.  The altibase.properties file

On omission, the user is prompted to enter a value immediately after aexporthas been executed. aexport may not work normally if the value is invalid.

If the option is not set, the first time aexport is run, it prompts for an option and prompts the user for a value.If incorrect format or an invalid value is entered, aexport may not work properly.

One exception is the NLS_USE option. On omission, the user is not prompted to enter a value, but the database character set is used by default. If the user omits the NLS_USE option in an environment that does not use the US7ASCII character set, aexport will run abnormally with the risk of data loss. Therefore, the user should set the NLS_USE option to a value that is compatible with his or her operating environment.

The user is recommended to set the following environment variables for aexport to run normally:

-   ALTIBASE_HOME: The path where the server or client is installed.

-   ALTIBASE_PORT_NO: The port number used to connect to the server.

-   ALTIBASE_NLS_USE: The character set used to export and import data.

-   PATH: The path to the aexport executable file. It is normally $ALTIBASE_HOME/bin.

#### Environment Variables

##### ALTIBASE_HOME

Sets the directory in which the package was installed. This must be set to use aexport.

##### ALTIBASE_PORT_NO

Sets the port number used to connect to the server. This can also be set with the -port command-line option, or set in advance in the altibase.properties file.

If different values are set for the ALTIBASE_PORT_NO environment variable and the altibase.properties file, the environment variable takes precedence. However, the value set with the -port command-line option overrides both. On omission, the user will be prompted to enter a value after aexport has started.

##### ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO

Sets the server port number that aexport is to connect to over SSL/TLS. 

For the port number in SSL, the -PORT option, environment variables, ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO, and the properties in the altibase.properties file take precedence over each other (in consecutive order). On omission, the user is prompted to enter the port number.

##### ALTIBASE_NLS_USE

Sets the character set use when connecting to the server. This can also be set with the - nls_use command-line option, or be set in advance in the altibase.properties file.

If different values are set for the ALTIBASE_NLS_USE environment variable and the altibase.properties file, the environment variable takes precedence. However, the value set with the -nls_use command-line option overrides both.

Note: If the server character set and the value set in ALTIBASE_NLS_USE are different, it may not work properly. It is recommended to set the appropriate value.

#### Parameters

| Parameter                          | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \-h                                | Displays the Help menu                                       |
| \-s                                | Sets the host name or IP of the server from which to download data. On omission, the user is prompted for the host name. This can be a host name, an IPv4 address, or an IPv6 address. If it is an IPv6 address, it must be enclosed in square brackets (“[ ]“). The localhost (the same computer on which aexport is executed) can be set as the computer's host name, the localhost’s IPv4 address (usually 127.0.0.1), or the localhost IPv6 address (usually [::1]). For more information about Altibase and IPv6 address notation, please refer to the *Administrator's Manual.* |
| \-u                                | This sents the name of the Altibase user to access the server from whichd data is to be downloaded. On omission, the user is prompted for the user name.This option must be set to the SYS user to perform a full DB mode export. <br/>Use double quotation marks if there are lower case letters, special characters or spaces in the username. -u \"user name\" |
| \-p                                | Sets the password for the user. On omission, the user is prompted for a password. |
| \-port                             | Sets the server port number to access for data download. On omission, the ALTIBASE_PORT_NO environment variable and the altibase.properties setting are checked in turn to determine the port number. If neither is set, the user is prompted for a port number. |
| \-object                           | This option specifies an object which will be extracted along with the owner name. Use double quotation marks if there are lower case letters, special characters or space in the object name. -object \"user name\".\"table name\" |
| \-tserver                          | Sets the destination server (the server to which the exported data is to be uploaded). This information is written to the script files that are created when aexport is executed, and used when those scripts are subsequently executed. As with the -s option, this can be a host name, an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. |
| \-tport                            | Sets the destination server port number. This information is written to the script files that are created when aexport is executed, and used when those scripts are subsequently executed. |
| \-nls_use                          | Sets the character set to export (download) data from the source database and import (upload) data to the destination database. At present, the supported character sets are US7ASCII, KO16KSC5601, MS949, BIG5, GB231280, MS936, UTF8, SHIFTJIS, MS932 and EUCJP. |
| \-prefer_ipv6                      | This option determines whether to first attempt to resolve a host name to an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. If a host name is specified for the -s option and this option is used, aexport will first attempt to resolve the host name to an IPv6 address. In contrast, if a host name is specified for the -s option and this option is omitted, aexport will first attempt to resolve the host name to an IPv4 address. That is, the default behavior is to attempt to resolve the host name to an IPv4 address. If aexport fails to connect using the preferred IP address type, it attempts to connect using the other IP address type. For example, when localhost is specified for the -s option and this option is used, aexport first tries to connect to the [::1] IPv6 address. If this attempt fails, aexport then attempts to connect to the 127.0.0.1 IPv4 address. |
| \-ssl_ca *CA_file_path*            | Specifies the location of the certification authority (CA) certificate in which the public key of the Altibase server to be connected to is incorporated. |
| \-ssl_capath *CA_dir_path*         | Specifies the directory under which the certification authority (CA) certificate in which the public key of the Altibase server to be connected is incorporated. |
| \-ssl_cert *certificate_file_path* | Specifies the location of the client authentication file.    |
| \-ssl_key *key_file_path*          | Specifies the location of the client private key file.       |
| \-ssl_verify                       | Verifies the certificate the client receives from the server. |
| \-ssl_cipher *cipher_list*         | Specifies a cipher list for SSL encryption. Please refer to the SSL_CIPHER_LIST property in the *General Reference.* |

> For more detailed information about SSL connection, please refer to Chapter 2. Connecting and Disconnecting in the *iSQL User’s Manual.* 

#### The Data Migration Process

The process of using aexport to migrate data can be roughly divided into the following steps:

-   Generate SQL script files for creating the structure of the objects to be exported from the source database and shell script files for executing the SQL script files
-   Export (download) the data from the source database
-   Create the required database structures in the destination database
-   Import (upload) the data to the destination database
-   Refresh the materialized view in the destination database, and create indexes and foreign keys in the destination database, and then switch the data access mode

##### Exporting the Source Database Structure

aexport is first used to generate SQL script files that contain information about the structure of the source database and shell script files for executing the SQL script files.

- Execute aexport

```
$ aexport –s 127.0.0.1 –u sys –p manager
```


-   Enter the passwords of the Altibase users at the prompts. This sets the password for each user that is created in the destination database. 
-   When using aexport to back up the data on a remote server, indicate the address of the remote server and the port through which to connect to the remote server.

```
$ aexport –s 222.112.84.200 –port 20300 –u sys –p manager
```


##### Exporting Data from the Source Database

Export (download) the data from the source database by executing the shell script that was created by aexport in the previous step.

-   Check the disk to which the data are to be downloaded to ensure that it has enough free space to hold the data. Because data in text form can occupy more space than the data in internally used data files, it is recommended that the amount of available free space be twice the size of the original data files.
-   Execute the "run_il_out.sh" script.

```
$ sh run_il_out.sh
```


##### Creating the Destination Database Structure

-   Copy all SQL scripts and shell scripts and all 'fmt', 'log', and 'dat' format files created by the “run_il_out.sh” shell script to the system on which the destination database is located. Skip this step if the destination database is on the same system as the source database.

-   Start up the destination database.

-   Execute the “run_is.sh” script.

```
$ sh run_is.sh
```

-   Use iSQL to access the database and check whether all of the required database objects were properly created. If the required database structure was not properly created, inspect the output that was displayed on the screen while run_is.sh was executing to determine the cause of the problem.

##### Importing Data into the Destination Database

- Execute the “run_il_in.sh” script.

```
$ sh run_il_in.sh
```


-   Check the directory containing the “run_il_in.sh” shell script file to see whether it contains any files that have the “*.bad” filename extension and are greater than 0 bytes in size. If such a file exists, inspect the contents of the “*.bad” file and the log files related to the table having the same name as the “*.bad” file and take suitable steps to resolve the problem. For more information on how to resolve such problems, please refer to the *iLoader User's Manual.*

##### Refresh the materialized view in the destination database, and create indexes and foreign keys in the destination database, and then switch the data access mode

When the TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT property is set to "Off":

- Execute the "run_is_refresh_mview.sh" script.

```
$ sh run_is_refresh_mview.sh
```


- Execute the “run_is_index.sh” script.

```
$ sh run_is_index.sh
```


- Execute the “run_is_fk.sh” script.

```
$ sh run_is_fk.sh
```


- Execute the “run_is_alt_tbl.sh” script.

```
$ sh run_is_alt_tbl.sh
```


When TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT = ON:

- Execute the “run_is_con.sh” script.

```
$ sh run_is_con.sh
```




#### Notes

-   If a normal user who is not the SYS user executes aexport, scripts are created only for the user's schema.
-   If a normal user who is not the SYS user executes aexport, scripts are created for replication objects.
-   If a normal user who is not the SYS user executes aexport, CREATE TABLE privileges are required. This is because aexport creates temporary tables to analyze object interdependencies.
-   Do not run two or more aexport processes at the same time. Because aexport uses a temporary table to store created SQL scripts, running two or more aexport processes at the same time will yield unpredictable results.
-   If the EXECUTE and TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT aexport properties are both set to ON and the OPERATION property is set to IN when uploading data, this uploading operation will not be affected by the value of the INDEX property, because no SQL script file dedicated to creating the index is generated.  
    Therefore, when it is desired to perform the uploading operation (EXECUTE = ON and OPERATION = IN) with ON for the INDEX property, the TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT property must be set to OFF.
-   When the “run_is.sh” script is executed, all existing users and objects will be deleted from the database. Therefore, care must be taken to avoid executing this script on the source database.
-   If the -tserver and -tport options are not specified, then the -s and -p parameters are used not only to identify the source server from which data are downloaded, but are also used in all created scripts to identify the destination server to which data will be uploaded. To specify a destination server and port that are different from the source server and port,  use the -tserver and -tport options. In this case, the -s and -p options will only identify the source server from which data are downloaded, whereas the values specified for the -tserver and -tport options will be written into the created scripts.

```
$ aexport -s 127.0.0.1 -u sys -p manager -tserver 192.168.1.10 –tport 21300

$ cat run_il_in.sh

iloader -s 192.168.1.10 -port 21300 -u SYS -p MANAGER in -f SYS_T1.fmt -d
SYS_T1.dat -log SYS_T1.log -bad SYS_T1.bad
```


-   If CALLBACK functions are specified using PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION at user creation, the user’s password must be set to correspond to validity functions before user importation. Validity functions must also be imported before importing the user to the database.
-   Double quotation marks should be used if there are lower case letters, special characters or spaces in the user name or the name of objects which will be extracted.



#### Limitations

-   If a stored procedure needs to refer to when creating a stored procedure is not created in advance, the operation will fail. aexport cannot guarantee the order in which stored procedures are created because they cannot access information about dependencies between stored procedures. In this case, the stored procedure creation can fail, so the stored procedure must be created in the destination  database.
-   aexport only has limited access to the meta information of the sequence. Because of this restriction, only the sequence characteristics specified by the INCINMENT BY of a sequence created in an account other than the SYS user are reflected, and the remaining attributes are set to the default values. If these constraints are a problem, the sequence must be created in the destination database.
-   In creating an object in the destination database, the base table must be created before creating the Material View. Because aexport does not guarantee the table creation order for creating materialized views, it may fail to create a materialized view. In this case, the user must manually create a materialized view
-   When aexport extracts the materialized view creation statement from the source database, it imports the statement that originally created the materialized view. That is, even if the DDL statement that changes the refresh method or refresh change time is executed for the materialized view in the source database, the change is not reflected in the statement extracted by aexport.



#### SSL Connection and Script Files

-   If aexport is executed on SSL, the SSL option that was specified to execute aexport is used with the source database connection script (run_il_out.sh).
  
-   In to connect an SSL to the target databe, the SSL related properties must be set in the property file.  Refer to ILOADER_ARRAY in the aexport property section for a detailed description.  
    ILOADER_ARRAY = *count* (Default: 1)  
    Speifcies the number of rows to process at once when downloading or uploading data to iLoader.
    
-   ILOADER**\_**COMMIT  
    ILOADER**\_**COMMIT = *count* (Default: 1000)  
    Specifies the unit (number) to commit when uploading data to iLoader. The value of the -commit option can be specified with this property.
    
-   ILOADER_PARALLEL  
    ILOADER_PARALLEL = *count* (Default: 1)  
    Specifies the number of threads to process in parallel when downloading or uploading to iLoader.
    
-   ILOADER_ASYNC_PREFETCH  
    ILOADER_ASYNC_PREFETCH = OFF\|ON\|AUTO (Default: OFF)  
    Sets asynchronous prefetch behavior when downloading data to iLoader. For more informaiton please refer to the '-async_prefetch' option in the *iLoader User's Manual.*
    
-   Refer to the SSL_ENABLE property.



#### aexport Properties

##### Setting the aexport Properties

Some of the settings that govern the use of aexport are made in the aexport.properties file. The aexport.properties file must be located in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf directory. (This file is not to be confused with the altibase.properties file, which by default is located in the same directory.)

When Altibase is installed, the \$ALTIBASE_HOME/conf directory does not actually contain a file called aexport.properties, but it does contain a sample properties file called aexport.properties.sample. It is thus necessary to copy the aexport.properties.sample, paste it into the same directory, and rename it as aexport.properties before executing aexport. If aexport cannot find the aexport.properties file in \$ALTIBASE_HOME/conf, it will raise an error and terminate.

##### List of aexport Properties

-   OPERATION  
    OPERATION = IN/OUT  
    If this property is set to OUT, scripts for exporting all schemas and data will be created. When the data export script, which consists of iLoader commands, is executed, form files (.fmt) and data files (.dat) will be created.  
    If this property is set to IN, the schema creation script and the data loading script, which were created by previously executing aexport with this property set to OUT, will be executed, the schema will be created in the destination database, and the data will be loaded into the destination database. The schema creation script and the data loading script can be executed manually at a shell prompt without executing aexport.
-   EXECUTE  
    This property determines whether to automatically execute the scripts that were created.  
    EXECUTE = ON/OFF  
    If it is set to ON, the scripts that are appropriate for the current operation (set using the OPERATION property) will be executed automatically. The file names of these scripts are set using the ILOADER_OUT, ILOADER_IN, ISQL, ISQL_CON, ISQL_INDEX, ISQL_FOREIGN_KEY, ISQL_ALT_TBL, and ISQL_REPL properties.  
    If it is set to OFF, the scripts will be created, but not executed.
-   INVALID_SCRIPT  
    This property determines whether to group all of the object creation scripts for invalid objects in a single script file.  
    INVALID_SCRIPT = ON/OFF  
    If this property is set to OFF, a SQL script file will be generated for each of the invalid objects in the database; that is, they will be treated just like the valid database objects.
-   TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT  
    This property determines whether to group all of the object creation scripts in two script files.  
    TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT = ON/OFF  
    If this property is set to ON, aexport will create only two SQL script files and two shell script files: ALL_OBJECT.sql, ALL_OBJECT_CONSTRAINS.sql, ALL_OBJECT.sql, run_is.sh, run_is_con.sh  
    If this property is set to OFF, aexport will generate different SQL script files for each of the objects in a database.
-   CRT_TBS_USER_MODE  
    CRT_TBS_USER_MODE = ON/OFF (Default: OFF)  
    This property determines whether or not to extract a statement for creating tablespace in user mode.  
    If this property is set to ON, the SQL statement creating tablespace related to the user in the user mode is extracted. The user related tablespaces are default tablespace, default temporary tablespace, and the tablespace specified whether or not to available to be accessed.
-   INDEX  
    INDEX = ON/OFF  
    This property determines whether or not to create the indexes when creating the rest of the schema in the destination database. If it is desired to create the indexes after the data have been located into the destination database, set this property to ON. It is used when the TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT property is set to OFF.
-   USER_PASSWORD  
    USER_PASSWORD = *password*  
    This property is used to set the password when the users exported from the source database are created in the destination database. (Because aexport does not know the passwords of users exported from the source database, the passwords must be manually set.) If this property is not set, a prompt for setting each user's password will appear.
-   VIEW_FORCE  
    VIEW_FORCE = ON/OFF  
    If this property is set to ON, views will be forcibly created, even if the underlying tables or other objects don't exist.
-   DROP  
    This property determines whether to include DROP statements in created scripts.  
    DROP = ON/OFF  
    If this property is set to ON, and if the destination database already contains objects corresponding to those that are to be created, the existing objects will be dropped. Because this option specifies that existing objects are to be dropped, it should be used with caution.  
    Note) If aexport is executed in Object Mode, DROP statements are not generated, regardless of the setting of this property.
-   ILOADER_OUT  
    ILOADER_OUT = *run_il_out.sh*  
    This property determines the name of the shell script file that is created to export (download) the data from the source database. It is used when the OPERATION property is set to OUT.
-   ILOADER_IN  
    ILOADER_IN = *run_il_in.sh*  
    This property determines the name of the shell script file that will be used to import (upload) the data into the destination database.
-   ISQL  
    ISQL = *run_is.sh*  
    This property determines the name of the script file that will be used to create the database schema in the destination database.
-   ISQL_CON  
    ISQL\_ CON = *run_is_con.sh*  
    This property determines the name of the shell script file that is used to execute the SQL script files for creating indexes, foreign keys, triggers and replication objects. It is used when the TWO_PHASE_SCRIPT property is set to ON.
-   ISQL_INDEX  
    ISQL_INDEX = *run_is_index.sh*  
    This property determines the name of the shell script that will be used to create indexes in the destination database. If no value is specified for this property in the aexport.properties file, this shell script file will not be generated.
-   ISQL_FOREIGN_KEY  
    ISQL\_ FOREIGN_KEY = *run_is_fk.sh*  
    This property determines the name of the shell script file that is used to execute the SQL script files for creating foreign keys. If no value is specified for this property in the aexport.properties file, this shell script file will not be generated.
-   ISQL_REPL  
    ISQL_REPL = *run_is_repl.sh*  
    This property determines the name of the shell script that will be used to create replication objects in the destination database. If no value is specified for this property in the aexport.properties file, this shell script file will not be generated.
-   COLLECT_DBMS_STATS  
    This property determines whether to display the statistics for tables, columns and indexes of specified user.  
    COLLECT_DBMS_STATS = ON/OFF  
    The default value is OFF and no statistical information is exported. When this property's value is ON, statistics information is exported.
-   ISQL_REFERSH_MVIEW  
    ISQL_REFERSH_MVIEW = *run_is_refresh_mview.sh*  
    This property determines the name of the shell script that will be used to execute the SQL script files for refreshing the materialized view in the destination database. If no value is specified for this property in the aexport.properties file, this shell script file will not be generated.
-   ISQL_ALT_TBL  
    ISQL_ALT_TBL = *run_is_alt_tbl.sh*  
    This property sets the name of the shell script file executing the SQL script which switches the data access mode for the tables and partitions of the target database. On omission, aexport does not generate this shell script file.
-   ILOADER_FIELD_TERM  
    ILOADER_FIELD_TERM = *field_term*  
    This property is used to set the field delimiters that are used when the data in tables are saved as text. If this property is not set, the default delimiter between values is the comma (“,”), no block delimiters are used for numeric values, and double quotation marks (“ “ “) are used as block delimiters around strings.  
    Note) The pound (i.e. hash or number sign) character “#” cannot be specified as a delimiter, because it is used to denote comments in the properties file (The remainder of the line after the “#” will be ignored).
-   ILOADER_ROW_TERM  
    ILOADER\_ ROW \_TERM = *row_term*  
    This property sets the record delimiter to use wwhen texting table data. If not set, the default is <LF\>.  
    Note) The pound (i.e. hash or number sign) character “#” cannot be specified as the record delimiter, because it is used to denote comments in the properties file (The remainder of the line after the “#” will be ignored).
-   ILOADER_PARTITION  
    This property determines whether or not to create SQL scripts and shell scripts for creating partitions.  
    ILOADER\_ PARTITION = ON/OFF  
    If this property is set to ON, shell scripts for exporting data from partitions, for creating partitioned tables and all of their partitions, and for importing data into each partition are generated. In other words, enabling this property makes it possible to import data from table partitions in the source database into corresponding partitions in partitioned tables in the destination database.  If this property is set to OFF, whether tables in the source database are partitioned is ignored, and the shell script that is generated creates non-partitioned tables in the destination database and imports data from all partitions of partitioned tables in the source database into corresponding non-partitioned tables in the destination database.  
        For more detailed infomraiton, please refer to the *iLoader User's Manual.*  
-   ILOADER_ERRORS  
    ILOADER_ERRORS = *count* (Default: 50)  
    This property specifies the number of allowable maximum errors when uploading data with iLoader. The default value of this property is set to 50, and the upload is continuously executed regardless of the number of incurring errors if the default value is set to 0.
-   ILOADER_ARRAY  
    ILOADER_ARRAY = *count* (Default: 1)  
    This property specifies the number of rows to be processed at once when downloading or uploading data with iLoader.
-   ILOADER**\_**COMMIT  
    ILOADER**\_**COMMIT = *count* (Default: 1000)  
    This property specifies the unit(number) to commit when uploading the data with iLoader. The value of -commit option can be specified as well.
-   ILOADER_PARALLEL  
    ILOADER_PARALLEL = *count* (Default: 1)  
    This property specifies the number of threads which will be executed with parallel processing when uploading or downloading with iLoader.
-   ILOADER_ASYNC_PREFETCH  
    ILOADER_ASYNC_PREFETCH = OFF\|ON\|AUTO (Default: OFF)  
    This property sets asynchronous prefect behavior when downloading data to iLoader. For more information, please refer to the '-async_prefetch' option in the *iLoader User's Manual.*
-   SSL_ENABLE  
    This property specifies whether to connect to the target database using the SSL protocol.  
    SSL_ENABLE = ON/OFF  
    If this property is set to ON, SSL-related options are enabled for iSQL and iLoader commands in the shell scripts (run_is.sh and run_il_in.sh) to be executed on the target database.  
    SSL-related options can be enabled with the SSL_CA, SSL_CAPATH, SSL_CERT, SSL_KEY, SSL_CIPHER, SSL_VERIFY properties. For further information about these properties, please refer to Parameters.

## 2. altiComp

This chapter describes the altiComp utility and its features such as consistency control. 

### Introducing altiComp

The altiComp utility monitors the progress of replication between two Altibase databases and resolves data inconsistencies that arise during the course of replication.

altiComp compares Altibase with another HDB on a table-by-table basis, and outputs information about any inconsistencies it finds. It also has a feature for synchronizing two databases in the event of data inconsistencies.

#### altiComp Terms

##### Master Server

Master Server is a server to be corrected when a discrepancy record is found between two servers. When running altiComp, either server can be designated as master.

##### Master DB

The database on the master server.

##### Slave Server

When the discrepancy record between two servers is found, Slave Server is the server to be corrected according to the reference database. When running altiComp, either server can be designated as a slave.

##### Slave DB

The database on the slave server.

#### Different Records

Different records are records whose column values do not match based on the primary key between the Master DB and Slave DB.

There are three types of differences:

-   MOSX difference: When a record based on a primary key can be found in the Master DB but not in the Slave DB.
-   MOSO difference: When a record based on a primary key can be found in both the master and slave tables but the record contents are different.
-   MXSO difference: When a record based on a primary key can be found in the Slave DB but not in the Master DB.

#### Synchronization Policy

A synchronization policy is a policy that specifies how to synchronize different records. alticomp usually treats the Master DB as the reference DB and synchronizes the Slave DB with it.

Altibase provides four synchronization policies: 

-   SU Policy: This policy resolves MOSO differences by updating the Slave DB with the contents of the Master DB.
    ![](media/Utilities/su_policy_eng.png)
-   SI Policy: This policy resolves MOSX differences by inserting records from the Master DB into the Slave DB.
    ![](media/Utilities/si_policy_eng.png)
-   MI Policy: This policy resolves MXSO differences by inserting records from the Slave DB into the Master DB.
    ![](media/Utilities/mi_policy_eng.png)
-   SD Policy: This policy resolves MXSO differences by deleting records from the Slave DB. 

![](media/Utilities/sd_policy_eng.png)

The SU policy, SI policy, MI policy, and SD policy are set in the altiComp environment file. Note that the MI policy and the SD policy are mutually exclusive, meaning that they cannot both be enabled at the same time.

##### DIFF

Creates an execution result file that identifies inconsistent records found during replication between the Master DB and the Slave DB.

##### SYNC

Identifies inconsistent records between the Master DB and the Slave DB, bidirectionally resolves inconsistencies according to the synchronization policy set in the altiComp environment file, and creates an execution result file including execution summary information and error information.

##### altiComp Environment File

An environment file is for setting options for altiComp. This file includes conneciton information, altiComp function settings, synchronization policies, etc.



### How to Use altiComp

This chapter describes the altiComp environment file that contains information for running altiComp, and explains the DIFF and SYNC features.

#### How to Execute altiComp

To use altiComp, an altiComp environment file, which contains information about the table(s) on which DIFF or SYNC is to be executed, must first be created. The altiComp environment file will be explained in the How to Use altiComp section.

altiComp commands have the following form: 

```
$ altiComp -f script_file_name
```

script_file_name : File name including the path of the environment file

If the current directory is: /user/charlie/altibase_home/altiComp:

```
/user/charlie/altibase_home/altiComp> altiComp script_file_name
```

Or

```
/user/charlie/altibase_home/altiComp> altiComp  ./script_file_name
```



#### How to Set altiComp Properties

Each comparison and synchronization task that is described in the environment file, has its own unique properties. The properties provide information necessary for running altiComp (Please refer to the sample.cfg file in the ALTIBASE_HOME/altiComp directory).

##### Rules for Setting Properties

Properties follow the format “**property name = property value**” and are case-insensitive. 

The following symbols have special meanings when used in the environment file:

-   “ **\#** “ (sharp) indicates a comment and causes the remainder of the line to be ignored. 
-   “ **{ }** “ (curly braces) used to indicate that a property value spans multiple lines.
-   “ **;** “ (semicolon) serves as a delimiter to separate multiple values.
-   “ **“** “ (double quotation marks) are used to enclose a string (such as a user name, password, table name, or column name) that includes one or more reserved words or special characters.
-   In Altibase, the following are special characters: \~, !, \@, \#, \$, %, \^, &, \*, (, ), \_, +, \|

##### Property Names

A property name consists of characters other than spaces, and identifies a property within a group.

##### Property Values

A property can take a single value, multiple values, or an expression. 

-   An expression may include blanks. Most properties follow this format:
    Ex) TABLE = EMPLOYEE

-   Multiple values consist of several values separated by the “**;**” delimiter, and must be contained within “{}” if they occupy more than one line (see Example 2). The “EXCLUDE” group allows multiple values.
    Ex) EXCLUDE = ENO; DNO; ENAME
    Or EXCLUDE = {ENO; DNO; ENAME}
-   Expressions are character strings, can include spaces, and must be enclosed within “{}”. The “WHERE” property is an expression.
    Ex) WHERE = { ENO \> ‘1000’ and ENO \< ‘2000’ }

##### Data Type Support

The EXCLUDE property is used as follows to exclude a particular column or columns from altiComp targets.

Example 4) Exclude a certain column from altiComp targets, if a CLOB column exists in the EMP table. 

TABLE = EMP
EXCLUDE = { CCC }



#### Property Options

Use the following properties to specify information for accessing the local and remote servers, comparison (DIFF) and synchronization (SYNC) tasks, and synchronization policies for inconsistent records. 

##### DB_MASTER

This is used to set the server whose contents are to be accepted as correct if inconsistent records are found between two servers.

Sets the user name and password, the name or IP address of the server, and NLS_USE. The property values must match the information in the property file in the home directory of Altibase.

- TCP Connection:

```
DB_MASTER = altibase://sys:manager@DSN=192.188.1.1;PORT_NO=20300;NLS_USE=US7ASCII
```

- SSL Connection:

```
DB_MASTER = altibase://sys:manager@DSN=192.188.1.1;PORT_NO=${ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO};NLS_USE=US7ASCII;CONNTYPE=6;SSL_CA=/home/altibase/cert/ca-cert.pem;SSL_CERT=/home/altibase/cert/client-ert.pem;SSL_KEY=/home/altibase/cert/client-key.pem
```


For more detailed  information about connection string attributes for SSL, please refer to the *SSL/TLS User’s Guide.* 

##### DB_SLAVE

This is used to set the other server. 

This sets the user name and password, the name or IP address of the server, and NLS_USE. The property values must match the information in the property file in the home directory of Altibase. 

##### OPERATION

This is set to “DIFF” for a comparison task, or to “SYNC” for a synchronization task.

##### INSERT_TO_SLAVE

This sets the SI policy used to resolve MOSX inconsistencies. Specifies whether to insert the record in question into the Slave DB. The property value is set to “ON” to specify that the record is to be inserted, and “OFF” to specify that it is not to be inserted.

##### INSERT_TO_MASTER

This sets the MI policy used to resolve MXSO inconsistencies. Specifies whether to insert the  52 Utilities Manual record in question into the Master DB. The property value is set to “ON” to specify that the record is to be inserted, and “OFF” to specify that it is not to be inserted. 

This property and DELETE_IN_SLAVE cannot both be set to “ON” simultaneously.

##### DELTE_IN_SLAVE

Sets the SD policy used to resolve MXSO inconsistencies. Specifies whether to delete the record in question from the Slave DB. The property value is set to “ON” to specify that the record is to be deleted, and “OFF” to specify that it is not to be deleted. 

This property and INSERT_TO_MASTER cannot both be set to “ON” simultaneously.

##### UPDATE_TO_SLAVE

This sets the SU policy used to resolve MOSO inconsistencies. Specifies whether to update the record in question in the Slave DB. The property value is set to “ON” to specify that the record is to be changed, and “OFF” to specify that it is not to be changed. 

##### CHECK_INTERVAL

This sets the interval between the completion of a SYNC operation on a table and the start of a SYNC operation on the next table. Expressed in units of ms (milliseconds).

##### MAX_THREAD

This specifies the maximum number of threads that can run concurrently. Set to -1 to specify an unlimited number of threads.

##### FILE_MODE_MAX_ARRAY

If its value is greater than 1, altiComp writes the fetched data to a file and then starts a SYNC or DIFF operation on the file. This value is used to set the maximum size of array(s) for fetching data. altiComp fetches a number of records equal to this value and writes them to a csv file. 

This option can be used to realize better performance. However, when a target table has many LOB type columns, this option may not improve performance. 

This option can only be used between Altibases.

Ex) FILE_MODE_MAX_ARRAY = 1000

#### TABLES Group

This defines information related to target table(s). The number of descriptions in the group must equal the number of target tables, and the name of each group must correspond to the name of a table in the Master DB. 

The following properties can be set:

##### WHERE

Sets conditions for selecting table records. This property is described in the same way as a WHERE clause of a SQL statement. Multiple values are permitted, but the “;” delimiter cannot be used to specify multiple values. Moreover, this property cannot be commented. 

This applies to the comparison (DIFF) and synchronization (SYNC) functions. 

##### EXCLUDE

This sets conditions for the projection of table records. The property may have multiple values. The specified columns are excluded from comparison and synchronization operations. 

![](media/Utilities/e9cd168e51d8336eb99f9ba958d9688d.png)

![](media/Utilities/c8502d42132454c28fe8e7f0edd7c88b.png)

With the proper combination of WHERE and EXCLUDE, the result of combining selection and projection altiComp can be used.

![](media/Utilities/3a664d250cbb847a5d4acd3acf65b5d1.png)

##### TABLE

This sets the Slave DB table name. In cases where the table names on the Master DB and the Slave DB differ from each other, this must be explicitly described in order to use the comparison (DIFF) and synchronization (SYNC) functions. if omitted, it is assumed that the table name on the Slave DB is the same as that on the Master DB. 

The table name can contain Roman alphabetic characters, numbers, and the following special characters: ((space,\~, !, \@, \#, \$, %, \^, &, \*, (, ), \_, +, \|)

However, it cannot contain Korean characters.

##### SCHEMA

This specifies the table schema in the Slave database

If the schema name of the connecting user of Slave is different from the schema of the target table, it must be described. If omitted, the schema of the connecting user of Slave is used.

### Comparison (DIFF) Function

This function identifies different records that are found during replication between the Master and Slave databases, and creates an execution result file.

#### Environment File

In the altiComp environment file, set the OPERATION property to “DIFF”. 

All execution option properties must be specified, and the table group properties WHERE, EXCLUDE, TABLE, and SCHEMA can be optionally specified.

#### Execution

The comparison (DIFF) function is executed as follows:

```
$ altiComp -f script_file_name
```

script_file_name: File name including the path of the environment file

#### Execution Results

This function compares the contents of the Master and Slave Databases with each execution log file and table, and creates an execution result file that includes the contents of inconsistent columns of inconsistent records.

For example,

For example, if you run the following altiComp command successfully, /user/charlie/altibase_home/altiComp> altiComp sample.cfg a “mastertable-username.slavetable.log” file is created for each table in the altiComp directory, alongside sample.log. 

##### Execution Log File

This file is created as “script_file_name.log” and displays the contents of the executed environment file with a summary of the comparison (DIFF) task for each table in the TABLES group. 

The contents of the environment file are displayed as follows:

```
INFO[ MNG ] Tread #  0 init is   OK!
INFO[ MNG ] Tread #  0 start is  OK!

[TAB_2->TAB_2]
Fetch Rec In Master: 3
Fetch Rec In Slave : 2
MOSX = DF, Count :          1
MXSO = DF, Count :          0
MOSO = DF, Count :          1

 SCAN TPS:   20547.95
     Time:       0.00 sec
```



##### Execution Result File

This file is created as “mastertable username.slavetable.log” and displays the comparison results in the following format. 

```
DF[m,n]-> COL_N (Vn_M, Vn_S):PK->{ PCOL_V }
```



-   DF : The type of inconsistency (MOSX, MOSO, MXSO) 
-   m : The record number on the Master server 
-   n : The record number on the Slave server 
-   COL_N : The name of the first column that has different values after comparison
-   Vn_M : The value in the corresponding column on the Master server 
-   Vn_S : The value in the corresponding column on the Slave Server

However, for records that have LOB type columns, the LOB column value is not output.

#### Comparison (DIFF) Examples

The following examples compare the EMP table of host1 with the EMPLOYEES table of host2, and the DEPARTMENTS table of host1 and the DEPARTMENTS table of host2. 

##### DIFF Example 1

Specify DB_MASTER as host1 and DB_SLAVE as host2. The environment file for comparing all the records in each table should look like this:

```
DB_MASTER = "altibase://sys:manager@DSN=host1;PORT_NO=10111;NLS_USE=US7ASCII"
DB_SLAVE = "altibase://sys:manager@DSN=host2;PORT_NO=20111;NLS_USE=US7ASCII"
OPERATION = DIFF
MAX_THREAD = -1
			
DELETE_IN_SLAVE = ON
INSERT_TO_SLAVE = ON
INSERT_TO_MASTER = ON
UPDATE_TO_SLAVE = ON

LOG_DIR = "./"
LOG_FILE = "sample.log"

[EMP]
TABLE = EMPLOYEES
SCHEMA = SYS 

[DEPARTMENTS]
TABLE = DEPARTMENTS
SCHEMA = SYS
```

The name of the target table for the Master Server (host1) and Slave Server (host2) may differ, as shown in the above example. 

##### DIFF Example 2

From the EMP table, select the values to be compared according to the ENO column, and exclude the JOIN_DATE and GENDER columns as below. 

The CONDITION property specifies that the EMP records to be compared as limited to “ENO >= 1 and ENO <= 20". 

The EXCLUDE property specifies that the JOIN_DATE and GENDER columns are not to be compared. 

In other words, if all columns (other than the JOIN_DATE and GENDER columns) are identical, it is assumed that the record is the same. 

```
[EMP]
TABLE = EMPLOYEES
WHERE = {ENO >= 1 and ENO <= 20}
EXCLUDE = {JOIN_DATE; SEX}
[DEPARTMENTS]
```



##### DIFF Example 3

From the EMP table, select the values to be compared according to the ENO and JOIN_DATE columns, and exclude the GENDER column as below.

```
[EMP]
TABLE = EMPLOYEES
WHERE = {(ENO >= 1 and ENO <= 20) or (JOIN_DATE >= ‘20001010’)}
EXCLUDE = {SEX}

[DEPARTMENTS]
```

The WHERE property determines whether the EMP records for comparison are to be limited by “ENO >= 1 and ENO <= 20" or “JOIN_DATE >= 20001010”. The EXCLUDE property specifies that the GENDER column is not to be compared.



### Synchronization (SYNC) Function

This function identifies records that are inconsistent between the Master and Slave databases, bidirectionally resolves the differences according to the synchronization policy in the altiComp configuration file, and creates an execution result file including execution summary information and error information.

#### Environment File

In the altiComp environment file, set the OPERATION property to “SYNC”. 

All execution option properties must be described, and the table group properties WHERE, EXCLUDE, TABLE, and SCHEMA can be optionally specified.

#### Execution

The synchronization (SYNC) function is executed as follows:

```
$ altiComp -f script_file_name
```

script_file_name: File name including the path of the environment file

#### Execution Results

This function compares the contents of the Master and Slave databases with each execution log file and table, and creates an execution result file that consists of information about synchronization tasks conducted on different records and an error log that includes information about errors which occurred during synchronization.

##### Execution Log File

This file is created as “script_file_name.log” and displays the contents of the executed environment file as well as the summary of the synchronization (SYNC) task for the table(s) in each TABLES group. 

The contents of the environment file are written to the log file as follows:

```
INFO[ MNG ] Tread #  0 init is   OK!
INFO[ MNG ] Tread #  0 start is  OK!

[TAB_2->TAB_2]
Fetch Rec In Master: 3
Fetch Rec In Slave : 2
MOSX =  -, SI 
MXSO =  -, -
MOSO =  -, SU
MXSX =  -, -

-----------------------------------------
 Operation  Type      MASTER           SLAVE

             Fail           0               0

 UPDATE    Try           X               1
             Fail           X               0

 DELETE    Try           X               0
             Fail           X               0
-----------------------------------------
 UPDATE    Try           0               2
             Fail           0               0
 OOP  TPS:   13698.63
 SCAN TPS:   20547.95
     Time:       0.00 sec
```

If a failure occurs for any record, the cause of the error and the record contents are written to the log file.

#### Synchronization (SYNC) Examples

The following examples show how to specify OPERATION and TABLE for the synchronization policy to resolve data inconsistency. 

##### SYNC Example 1

Insert an MOSX inconsistent record (a record that exists in the Master server, but not in the Slave server) into the Slave server, and ignore an MXSO inconsistent record ( a record that exists in the Slave server, but not in the Master server). 

```
Master Server = "altibase://sys:manager@DSN=host1;PORT_NO=10111;NLS_USE=US7ASCII"
Slave Server = "altibase://sys:manager@DSN=host2;PORT_NO=20111;NLS_USE=US7ASCII"
OPERATION = SYNC
MAX_THREAD = -1

DELETE_IN_SLAVE = OFF
INSERT_TO_SLAVE = ON
INSERT_TO_MASTER = OFF
UPDATE_TO_SLAVE = ON

LOG_DIR = "./"
LOG_FILE = "sample.log"

[EMP]
TABLE = EMPLOYEES
SCHEMA = SYS

[DEPARTMENTS]
TABLE = DEPARTMENTS
SCHEMA = SYS
```

The INSERT_TO_SLAVE property has been set to “ON” because the SI policy is required to resolve MOSX inconsistency. Likewise, the INSERT_TO_MASTER and DELETE_IN_SLAVE properties have been set to “OFF” because the MI and SD policies required to resolve MSXO inconsistency have been ignored. 

##### SYNC Example 2

Insert an MOSX inconsistent record (a record that exists in the Master Server, but not in the Slave server) into the Slave server, and an MSXO inconsistent record (a record that exists in the Slave server, but not in the Master server) into the Master server. 

```
Master Server = "altibase://sys:manager@DSN=host1;PORT_NO=10111;NLS_USE=US7ASCII"
Slave Server  = "altibase://sys:manager@DSN=host2;PORT_NO=20111;NLS_USE=US7ASCII"
OPERATION = SYNC
MAX_THREAD = -1

DELETE_IN_SLAVE = OFF
INSERT_TO_SLAVE = ON
INSERT_TO_MASTER = ON
UPDATE_TO_SLAVE = ON

LOG_DIR = "./"
LOG_FILE = "sample.log"

[EMP]
TABLE = EMPLOYEES
SCHEMA = SYS

[DEPARTMENTS]
TABLE = DEPARTMENTS
SCHEMA = SYS
```

The INSERT_TO_SLAVE property has been set to “ON” because the SI policy is required to resolve MOSX inconsistency. Likewise, the INSERT_TO_MASTER property has been set to “ON” because the MI policy is required to resolve MXSO inconsistency. However, the DELETE_IN_SLAVE property has been set to “OFF” because the SD policy is unnecessary. 

##### SYNC Example 3

Synchronize the Master and Slave servers. 

```
Master Server = "altibase://sys:manager@DSN=host1;PORT_NO=10111;NLS_USE=US7ASCII"
Slave Server  = "altibase://sys:manager@DSN=host2;PORT_NO=20111;NLS_USE=US7ASCII"
OPERATION = SYNC
MAX_THREAD = -1

DELETE_IN_SLAVE = ON
INSERT_TO_SLAVE = ON
INSERT_TO_MASTER = OFF
UPDATE_TO_SLAVE = ON

LOG_DIR = "./"
LOG_FILE = "sample.log"

[EMP]
TABLE = EMPLOYEES
SCHEMA = SYS

[DEPARTMENTS]
TABLE = DEPARTMENTS
SCHEMA = SYS
```

The SI and SD policies are necessary to synchronize the Master and Slave servers. Therefore, the INSERT_TO_SLAVE and DELETE_IN_SLAVE properties have been set to “ON”. 

##### SYNC Example 4

Please refer to schema.sql in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/APRE/schema directory.

Synchronize the EMPLOYEES table of the local server host1 with the EMPLOYEES table of the remote server host2 (delete 16 to 20 from the ENO column), and the DEPARTMENTS table of host1 with the DEPARTMENTS table of host2. 

First, set up replication between the local and remote servers. 

For the local server (IP: 192.168.1.11)

```
iSQL> CREATE REPLICATION rep1 WITH '127.0.0.1', 56342 FROM sys.employees TO sys.employees, FROM sys.departments TO sys.departments;
Create Success
iSQL>
```

For the remote server (IP: 127.0.0.1)

```
iSQL> CREATE REPLICATION rep1 WITH '192.168.1.11', 65432 FROM sys.employees TO sys.employees, FROM sys.departments TO sys.departments;
Create Success
iSQL>
```

If the current directory is /user/charlie/altibase_home/ altiComp:

```
$ vi sample.cfg
Master Server = "altibase://sys:manager@DSN=127.0.0.1;PORT_NO=20582;NLS_USE=US7ASCII"
Slave Server  = "altibase://sys:manager@DSN=192.168.1.11;PORT_NO=20582;NLS_USE=US7ASCII"

OPERATION  = SYNC
MAX_THREAD = -1

DELETE_IN_SLAVE = ON
INSERT_TO_SLAVE = ON
INSERT_TO_MASTER = OFF 
UPDATE_TO_SLAVE = ON

LOG_DIR = "./"
LOG_FILE = "sample.log"

[ EMPLOYEE S]
WHERE   = {ENO >= 1 and ENO <= 20}

## 3. dataCompJ

This chapter describes the functionality of the dataCompJ utility and describes its efficient ability to compare discrepant data and feature to match the data.

### Introducing dataCompJ

dataCompJ is a tool for verifying data consistency and resolving discrepancies between data after replicating data from Altibase database to other database. Also, dataCompJ is a data replicating tool and it operates upon a premise of using Altibase Adapter for Oracle (oraAdapter) or Adapter for JDBC (jdbcAdapter).

The verification of data consistency is performed on tables specified by a user in the environment file in order to examine the replicated data between heterogeneous databases, and a feature for matching data by directly applying inconsistent data to a slave database or outputting as a file is provided as well.

#### System Requirements

This section describes system requirement specification for installing dataCompJ, installation of dataCompJ, and enumerates database management systems that are compatible with dataCompJ.

##### Hardware Requirements

-   CPU: 800MHZ Pentium III or higher

-   Main Memory: 1024MB or higher

-   Disk: Free space more than 50MB

##### Software Requirements

-   When using Oracle database as a slave DB :  
    Java Runtime Environment (JRE) later than Oracle or IBM Java 5

-   When using MariaDB database as a slave DB :  
    Java Runtime Environment (JRE) later than Oracle or IBM Java 6

Note that dataCompJ can be performed independently regardless of hardware and operation system since it is a pure JAVA application; however, it is dependent upon the JAVA Runtime Environment (JRE). Therefore, JRE appropriate for the work environment should be installed. Also, the JAVA_HOME environment variable indicating installed JAVA directory should be configured.

##### Compatible Database Management System

-   Master DB: Altibase 5.3.3 or later

-   Slave DB

    -   Oracle Database 9i or later

    -   MariaDB 5.5.x or later

Refer to 'Terminology for dataCompJ' section for precise definitions for Master/Slave DB.

dataCompJ can be used with Altibase and various other databases. Since this tool uses JDBC driver to connect to database, the JDBC driver compatible with original and target database should be prepared. Several JDBC drivers appropriate for the supported databases are provided along with dataCompJ for your convenience.

#### Terms for dataCompJ

##### Master DB

Master DB indicates an Altibase database containing original data between two heterogeneous databases to be compared.

##### Slave DB

Slave DB indicates the other database to which the replicated data is applied between the two heterogeneous databases to be compared.

##### TablePair

TablePair means the comparison target of dataComJ specified by the user, and it is in table unit. TablePair represents a pair comprised of a table (Master table) in Master DB and a table (Slave table) in Slave DB.

##### Master Table

Master table is a orginal table in the Master DB specified by the user in TablePair.

##### Slave Table

Slave table is a comparison target table in the Slave DB specified by the user in TablePair.

#### Inconsistent Records and Synchronization Policy

##### Inconsistent Records

Inconsistent records signify records whose column values are inconsistent based on the primary key of the master and slave tables. The inconsistent record can be divided into three types as in the following.

1.  MOSO inconsistent: This is a case in which particular records with the same value of primary key columns can be found in both Master and Slave DB, but the value of non primary key columns are different from each other.
  
2.  MOSX inconsistent: This is a case in which records with values of primary key columns can be found in Master DB, but not in Slave DB.
  
3.  MXSO inconsistent: This is a case when there exists particular records with values of primary key columns only in Slave DB, not in Master DB.

##### How to Resolve the Inconsistent Record

If dataCompJ discovers inconsistent records, the following two functionalities are provided depending on the user's choice as delineated in dataCompJ environment file.

1.  DIFF: This function distinguishes inconsistent records between Master tables and Slave tables and records them to a CSV format file.
  
2.  SYNC: This function distinguishes inconsistent records between Master tables and Slave tables and resolves the inconsistency based upon the synchronization policy delineated in the dataCompJ environment file.

#### Synchronization Policy

Synchronization policy defines how to match up the records in slave tables in accordance with the records in master tables when dataCompJ discovers any inconsistent records. The synchronization policy provides the following three methods. 

1.  MOSO Inconsistency: This method updates records with the same primary key in slave tables based on the master table records with UPDATE_TO_SLAVE policy.
  
2.  MOSX  Inconsistency: This method is used to insert a record, which exists in the master table but not in the slave table, into the slave table.
  
3.  MXSO  Inconsistency: This method deletes records, which exists only in the slave table, but not in the master table, from the slave table.

### How to Use dataCompJ

This section describes how to run dataCompJ, environment file configuration of dataCompJ, and considerations when configuring it.

#### Intallation and Uninstallation

dataCompJ can be downloaded from the official Altibase Customer Support portal(http://altibase.com/support-center/en/). It is provided as a zip or tar.gz file by Name of the dataCompJCli which includes executable files and JDBC drivers.

dataCompJ only needs to be uncompressed. Within the directory created as a result of the uncompressing, there are dataCompJCli.sh, subdirectory and xml file. 

In order to uninstall dataCompJ, delete the directory in which dataCompJ is installed.

#### How to Execution dataCompJ

The followings are the command to execute dataCompJ in the Command Line Interface (CLI).

- Linux

```
$ dataCompJCli.sh -f dataCompJ_env_file_path
```


- Windows

```
C:\dataCompJ> dataCompJ.bat -f dataCompJ_env_file_path
```


##### dataCompJ_env_file_path

This indicates the file path of dataCompJ environment file, and dataCompJ.xml file is provided as default when installing.

#### Execution Steps for dataCompJ 

dataCompJ operates based on the environment file configured by the user, and it is largely divided into two phases such s build and run.

##### Build Steps

Build phase is an initial investigation step to determine whether the run phase can be performed based upon configured environment file. If any issue is discovered, it is output in the report file(dataCompJ_report.txt) and dataCompJ is terminated after progressing to going into the run phase is stopped.

1.  Read the environment file specified by the user.

2.  Verify whether the connection information described in the environment file is valid.

3.  Verify the meta information through connecting to both databases to validate the target tables described in the environment file. If either of the tables finds a problem, it prints it to a report file and exits dataCompJ.

##### Run Steps

Run phase is a step executing a function of either comparing(DIFF) or Synchronizationing(SYNC) of target tables according to the user's choice by comparing data of target tables. 

The execution result of each TablePair is output in the report file(dataCompJ_report.txt).

##### Output Files

If dataCompJ is executed, a report file and two log files are generated.

The output files generated by the comparison function(DIFF) is thoroughly delineated in the section 'Comparison (DIFF) Function'.

-   dataCompJ_report.txt: This is a report file in text form to convey the execution results to a user.
  
-   dataCompJ.log: This is a log file recording events that occurs during the program operation. Also, this file is used to trace details of execution history of the program.
  
-   This is a file generated in the run phase, and this file records details of inconsistent records being processed during the execution of comparison(Diff)/Synchronization(Sync) if  in the configuration file is set to true. If there are a lot of inconsistent records, a large-scaled file is created, and it is suggested to use this file only if it is required to record details of processing the inconsistent records since the program performance is degraded.

#### Configuration of dataCompJ Environment

Input of an environment file is essential in order to perform dataCompJ. dataCompJ.xml file is provided by default when installing, and it is also available to use after the user writes any file.  However, the environment file should be written based on the XML rules delineated in dataCompJ.xml, and it should be encoded with UTF-8 if multiple languages are included. The dataCompJ environment file can be extensively divided into three sections, such as Connections, Options, and TablePairs.

##### Connections

The Connections section is the space in which information for connecting to the Master DB and Slave DB is recorded.

###### \<MasterDB\> 

The connection information of Master DB is recorded. The Master DB should be Altibase database. The following XML elements are the sub-elements of the Master DB.

\<JdbcUrl\>  
This is a character string used to record information of JDBC connection other than user ID and password.

\<JdbcFilePath\>  
This is used to specify the path in which the JDBC jar file exist in order to connect to Master DB.

\<UserId\>  
This is used to specify the user ID in order to connect to the database.

\<Password\>  
This is used to specify the user password in order to connect to the database.

\<FetchSize\>  
This is used to specify the number of records that are fetched at once when importing data from the database. This is a selectable entry and the default value is set to 1,000.

\<BatchSize\>  
This is used to specify the number of records that are executed at once when performing an insert/delete/update in the database. For instance, if 10 is specified in this entry, insert/delete/update is performed in 10 records unit. This is a selective entry and the default value is set to 1,000. 

###### \<SlaveDB\> 

This is used to record the connection information of Slave DB. The sub-elements of Slave DB is identical to that of the Master DB. 

##### Options

Options section is a section in which the user setting value is inserted for performing dataCompJ.

###### \<Operation\> 

This is used to specify either the comparison(DIFF) or synchronization(SYNC) function for processing inconsistent data.

###### \<FileEncoding\> 

This is used to specify the type of encoding for files generated when dataCompJ is executed.

###### \<Diff\>

\<DirPath\>  
This is used to specify the directory path in which a CSV file is created as a result of comparing each target table when the comparison(DIFF) is executed. 

###### \<Sync\> 

The followings are options for executing the synchronization(SYNC) function.

\<MOSO UPDATE_TO_SLAVE="true"/\>  
This option specifies whether or not to update records in the slave table based on records in the master table if MOSO inconsistent data is detected. If 'False' is specified, the MOSO inconsistent data will not be processed.

\<MOSX INSERT_TO_SLAVE="true"/\>  
This option specifies whether or not to insert the records which exist only in the master table into the slave table if MOSX inconsistent data is detected. If 'False' is specified, the MOSX inconsistent data will not be processed.

\<MXSO DELETE_FROM_SLAVE="true"/\>  
This option specifies whether or not to delete a slave table record which does not exist in the master table if MXSO inconsistent is detected. If 'False' is specified, the MXSO inconsistent data will not be processed.

###### \<Log\>

The following XML elements are the sub-elements of a log.

\<DirPath\>  
This element specifies the directory path of log files created when dataCompJ is executed.

\<TraceInconsistentRecord\>  
This element specifies whether or not to record details of all the inconsistent records detected while diff/sync function is executed with true/false value. 

###### \<MaxThread\> 

This element indicates the maximum number of allocable threads. If it is specified to 0, dataCompJ allocates the number of CPU core of the machine as MaxThread.

##### TablePairs

TablePairs is the space in which comparison target tables are recorded. There are two methods for recording the comparison target tables, such as recording each individual information on the target tables, and specifying the text file path in which the table names are listed at once. Such methods can be used either individually or together. 

The methods for providing information on each individual table is as follows, and an advantage of controlling data comparison method is provided. For instance, it is also possible to exclude specific columns or only target data satisfying certain conditions can be compared. 

The comparison target table's name should be allowed by both Master DB and Slave DB. The user must use double quotation marks (") in XML file if the table name contains any space or special character as well as case-sensitive. For instance, when a comparision target table's name is Employee 01 of SYS schema, user must input the table name with double quotation marks as SYS."Employee 01" because it contains a space in its name.

###### \<TablePair\> 

This is a unit of target data comprised of a master and a slave table. The following XML elements are the sub-elements of TablePair.

\<MasterTable\>  
This element is the name of comparison target data and it can be specified as [*SchemaName*].TableName format. Unless otherwise specified, the user ID of Master DB is used as the default schema name. This entry is essential entry; thus, an error would be occurred if it is not written.

\<SlaveTable\>  
This element is the name of comparison target data and it can be specified as [*SchemaName*].TableName format. Unless otherwise specified, the user ID of Master DB is used as the default schema name. This entry is essential entry; thus, an error would be occurred if it is not written.

\<Exclude\>  
This element specifies a condition for projecting. This element can also specify multiple columns with a comma delimiter. This entry is a selectable entry and if this is not written, all the columns with data types supported by dataCompJ would be selected as comparison targets.

\<Where\>  
This elements specifies a condition for selecting table records. This is written with the identical method as delineated in the WHERE clause of SQL, and multiple conditions are allowed. This is a selectable entry, and all the records would be comparison targets if it is not written.

\<TableNameFilePath\>  
This element provides information on the text file path enumerating table names all at once as in the following, and there is a advantage in easily inputting tables if it is required to compare multiple tables.

```
<TableNameFilePath>table_name_file_path</TableNameFilePath>
```



table_name_file_path is the text file path enumerating table names. The name of comparison target can be specified with [*SchemaName*].TableName format, and each table is distinguished with a new-line character. The name of comparison target in Master DB should be identical to the name of comparison target in Slave DB.

###### Restrictions

The following restrictions should be considered when selecting comparison target tables. If any constraint is infringed, dataCompJ outputs the issue occurred during the build phase to the report file(dataCompJ_report.txt) and does not execute it in the run phase.

1.  A comparison target table should be identically(the column name, column order, data type, and primary key) composed. However, the data type should be compatible to that of the other database.
  
2.  The unsupported data type is automatically excluded from the comparison targets. (e.g., the binary type such as LOB)
  
3.  There should be at least more than one column which can compare values other than a primary key.
  
-   (Example 1) table1 (c1 int, c2 int, c3 CLOB, primary key (c1, c2))  
  (Example 2) table1 (c1 int, c2 int, c3 varchar(100), primary key (c1, c2))  

      c3 in the example 1 is the only column satisfying the 'Constraint 3'. However, it infringes 'Constraint 2' since the data type CLOB of c3 is not supported by dataCompJ. Therefore, comparison for table 1 is not allowed. c3 is the only column satisfying 'Constraint 3' in  78 Utilities Manual the example 2. Thus, the table 1 can be compared since the data type of c3, the varchar type, is supported by dataCompJ.



### Comparison (DIFF) Function

The comparison(DIFF) function identifies inconsistent records that might be occurred during the replication execution between Master DB and Slave DB and records them to the file, and it is an efficient ability to verify inconsistent records between the two database system.

#### Environment File

The values of  -  in dataCompJ environment file are specified with "DIFF". The entries of  and  must be filled in, and target tables must be described in.

##### dataCompJ.xml

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

</TablePairs>
</dataCompJ>
```



#### Execution Process

The comparison(DIFF) is executed as in the following.

```
$ dataCompJCli.sh -f dataCompJ.xml
```



#### Execution Result

As a execution result, a report file(dataCompJ_report.txt) in which the execution result is summarized and log files(dataCompJ.log, dataCompJ_data.log) in which the event is recorded duing the execution are created. Such files are delineated in the "Output Files" in detail. 

The table structure used in an example is as follows.

```
CREATE TABLE ex1 (C1 int primary key, C2 varchar(20), C3 CLOB, C4 int);
```



##### DIFF Execution

##### Executable Data File

The following 4 Comma-separated values(CSV) format data files are created in a TablePair unit as a result of selecting the comparison(DIFF).

-   *SchemaName.TableName*\_MASTER_diff.csv:  
    If MOSO is detected, this file stores the value of inconsistent record found in the master table in CSV form.

-   *SchemaName.TableName*\_SLAVE_diff.csv:  
    This file stores the value of inconsistent record found in the slave table in CSV form if MOSO inconsistency is detected.

-   *SchemaName.TableName*\_MASTER_only.csv:  
    This is a file that records the value of records existing only in the master table due to MOSX inconsistency, and the value is stored in CSV form. 
    
-   *SchemaName.TableName*\_SLAVE_only.csv:  
    This is a file that stores the value of records existing only in the slave table due to MXSO inconsistency, and the value is stored in CSV form.

Since the inconsistent data is stored in sequence in SchemaName.TableName_MASTER_diff.csv and SchemaName.TableName_SLAVE_diff.csv files, it is possible to intuitively compare the parts in which MOSO inconsistency occurred by comparing the two files in the diff function.

#### Example

The table structure used for examples is as follows.

```
CREATE TABLE ex1 (C1 int primary key, C2 varchar(20), C3 CLOB, C4 int); /* Unsupported data in C3 CLOB dataCompJ */
CREATE TABLE ex2 (C1 int primary key, C2 varchar(20), C3 int);
```



##### DIFF Example 1

This is an example specifying or omitting the schema name for two target tables. 

In the case of EX1 in the example below,  entry describes only the table name without a schema,  entry is omitted. The  only with the table name without a schema name uses inserted values in - as the schema name. The omitted  is processed assuming that it is the same value with .

C3 column in table described in Ex1 is automatically excluded from the comparison target since it is a CLOB which is unsupported data type by dataCompJ, and it is recorded in candidate tables entry in the report. 

In EX2 table, the schema and table names are specifically inserted by a user, and it is processed based on the inserted schema and table names.

### Synchronization(SYNC) Function

The Synchronization(SYNC) function identifies the inconsistent records which might occur during the heterogeneous replication between the master DB and slave DB and applies them to the slave DB. This feature allows synchronization for the two database system without any difficulties.

#### Environment Files

On the environment files in dataCompJ, such as the value of  -  should be specified as "SYNC". Both  and  elements are entered mandatory, and should be described for target tables.

### Data Type compatibility table between Other Databases

This section discuss about the data type mapping table between other databases supported by dataCompJ. If comparison is executed on tables with unsupported data types by dataCompJ, the comparison execution is processed as in the following manners.

-   If both master table and slave table are data types not supported by dataCompJ: An error stating that the data type is not supported in the build phase is displayed and then run phase will not be executed. 
  
-   If either the master table or the slave table is supported and one of them is an unsupported data type: In the build step, an error is reported to the report file (dataCompJ_report.txt) that the number of columns to be compared in the table is different, and the run phase is not performed.

If the column data type of the table to be compared is a data type supported by dataCompJ, but a combination of data types other than the inter-species data type compatibility table is used, the following processing is performed.

-   In cases where the data comparison itself is impossible (e.g., comparison between integer type and character type data type): A statement indicating the type is not compatible in the build phase, and the run phase is not performed.
  
-   For data types with ambiguous comparisons (e.g., integer and floating-point types): The run phase is performed since it cannot be processed in the build phase. However, all records in the execution result are treated as inconsistent records.

| DATE     | DATE TIMESTAMP | For DATE - TIMESTAMP, the precision is compared based on the shorter one. For example, Altibase DATE is supported up to microsecond, and Oracle's TIMESTAMP can be up to nano seconds. In this case, the comparison of records is based upon nanoseconds. For DATE-DATE, Oracle DATE types are supported up to YYYY-MM-DD HH: MM: SS. Therefore, in this case, the data of the Altibase DATE type is ignored, and only the format of YYYY-MM-DD HH: MM: SS is compared. |

## 4. Other Utilities

### altiAudit

#### About altiAudit

When auditing is performed on the Altibase server, the $ALTIBASE_HOME/trc directory is the default location for where the audit log file is created and audit logs are written; this location can be changed with the AUDIT_LOG_DIR property. Audit logs in the audit log file are written in binary format and are therefore, illegible by the user. The altiAudit utility converts and prints the audit log file in text format to enable the user to analyze them.

```
altiAudit [-s] {audit_log_file_name}
```



#### Syntax

![](media/Utilities/altiaudit.gif)

#### Descriptions

This converts and outputs audit logs written by the server in text format.

With the -s option, audit logs can also be printed in CSV format.

#### Examples

The following command prints audit logs in plain text format.

```
$ altiAudit $ALTIBASE_HOME/trc/alti-1366989680-0.aud
```

The results are printed as below:

### altibase

#### About altibase

altibase is the executable server file that controls all Altibase services.

```
altibase {-v|n}
```



#### Syntax

![](media/Utilities/altibase.gif)

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \-v       | Displays the version of Altibase that is currently installed |
| \-n       | Executes Altibase in the foreground                          |

#### Description 

altibase is the executable server file that controls all Altibase services.

To start up or shut down Altibase normally in a production environment, do not use this command. Instead, log into iSQL in SYSDBA mode and use the startup or shutdown command, or use the server command. The server command is actually a shell comprising several commands related to starting up and shutting down the server. For more information about the server utility, please refer to server in this document. 

For a complete explanation of how to start up and shut down Altibase, please refer to the *iSQL User's Manual* or the *Altibase Getting Started Manual*.

When the Altibase server process is started using iSQL, it runs in the background. In contrast, when the altibase command is executed at the shell prompt with the -n option, Altibase is executed in the foreground. This is used only for Altibase debugging purposes, and is not intended or recommended for live deployment, that is, for use in a production environment. 

Running the altibase executable file with the -v option does not start up the server, but merely outputs information about the currently installed version of Altibase.

#### References

Please refer to the *Altibase Getting Started*, the *Altibase Administrator’s Manual*, and the *Altibase iSQL User’s Manual* 

### altiMon

#### About altiMon

altimon.sh monitors the status of the Altibase server process and the related host system.

altimon.sh {start \| stop}

#### Syntax

![](media/Utilities/9f7b2fa1105d33ea554edb062ca8b96f.png)

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description        |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| start     | Run altimon        |
| stop      | Terminates altimon |

#### Description

altiMon consistently monitors Altibase server and the related host system in order to record the collected data into the log files.

altiMon mainly monitors information on operating system and database, and refer to the Setting altiMon Configuration for in-depth information. 

##### start

1. Set the JAVE_HOME environment variables.

2. Run the command. 

- Unix Platforms

```
$ altimon.sh start
```


3. If operation fails, verify the file $ALTIBASE_HOME/altiMon/logs/altimon.log.

##### stop

- Unix Platforms

```
$ altimon.sh stop
```


#### Operating System

altiMon uses PICL library written in C language in order to collect information on operating system. The PICL library is available on the operation systems describe in the chart below. 

| OS    | CPU          | Version                           | PICL Library                |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| AIX   | ppc64        | OS Version 5.3, 6.1, 7.1          | aix-ppc64-5.so              |
| HP-UX | ia64         | IA64                              | hpux-ia64-11.sl             |
| LINUX | X86_64 ppc64 | OS Version 2.6 glibc 2.5 or later | linux-x64.so linux-ppc64.so |

it can also be used after checking whether the PICL for the lower version works on the OS version that is not supported.

  ```
  $ cd $ALTIBASE_HOME/altiMon # java -Dpicl="<picl_lib_file>" -jar lib/com.altibase.picl.jar
  ```

Example)

This procedures verifies that the "aix-ppc64-5.so" PICL library is available on the unsupported version of the AIX operating system and runs altimon

1. Verify that PICL for lower versions works.

```
$ cd $ALTIBASE_HOME/altiMon 
$ java -Dpicl="aix-ppc64-5.so" -jar lib/com.altibase.picl.jar
```

2. After the general operation is verified, open the $ALTIBASE_HOME/bin/altimon.sh file and set the PICL file in the PICL_LIB variable.

```
PICL_LIB=-Dpicl="aix-ppc64-5.so"
```

3. Run altimon

```
$ altimon.sh start
```

##### Notes

altiMon requires java 1.5 version or above to operate.

The user should select the Java version equivalent to the number of bits of the PICL c library. For example, if the PICL c library is linux x64, 64bit Java should be used.

#### Setting altiMon Configuration 

It is required that the following files located in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/altiMon/conf directory should be configured in order to properly use altiMon

-   [config.xml](#config.xml)

-   [Metrics.xml](#metrics.xml)

-   [GroupMetrics.xml](#groupmetrics.xml)

| \<ActionScript\>db_usage.sh\</ActionScript\>                 | This tag configures the script file name to be executed when the threshold value is out of the specified range. <br />The script file should be existing in the following directory : $ALTIBASE_HOME/altiMon/action_scripts |

##### GroupMetrics.xml

The GroupMetrics.xml is a file defining the Group Metrics, which is comprised of OS Metric, Command Metric, and SQL Metric. The GroupMetric can be defined by using metrics specified in Metrics.xml. 

Unlike the common Metric measured values are stored to the *.log file, the data collected by group metric are stored to CSV files. 

| Tag Name                                    | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \<GroupMetric Name='group1' Interval='30'\> | Configure Group Metric.<br />Name: metric name (Required) <br />Activate: Data collecttion status (Optional). Available value is either true or false. The default value is true.<br /> Interval: Data collection cycle (Necessary) |
| \<Target MetricName='PROC_CPU_USER'/\>      | This specifies the base metric which will be included in the group metric. <br />MetricName: The name of OSMetric, Command Metric or SQLMetric whick is defined in Metrics.xml.<br />A SQL Metric should necessarily retrieve one row of a SELECT query. When specifying DISK_FREE, or DISK_FREE_PERCENTAGE, a character string which is linked with 'Metric Name' and 'Disk Name' with ‘.’ should be specified as a MetricName. <br />\<Target MetricName='DISK_FREE.disk1'/\> |
| \<Column Name='LOG_GAP' /\>                 | In the case of the SQL Metric, the columns which will be included in the group metric are specified by this tag. <br />If this tag is not specified, every select target will be included in the Group Metric.<br />Name: The target column used in a SELECT query. If you specify an alias, the alias should be used. |

##### Others

-   action_scripts directory  
     In order to normally execute a script file specifying the tag, the script file should be located in the directory $ALTIBASE_HOME/altiMon/action_scripts.  
    For example, 'db_usage.sh' file in db_usage.sh should be located under the action_scripts directory in order for a script file to normally executes.

#### Output Items

The items are outptted with the folllowing format in the directories below. 

##### logs directory

-   altimon.log  
    This is the file recording all sorts of logs(info, warn, error) by altiMon daemon.

-   alert.log  
    This file records the data relevant to the  setting.

-   OsMetrics.log  
    This file records all the collected data by all the OS Metric.

-   [SQLMetric_Name].log  
    The collected data by SQL Metric are recorded into a different log file for each Metric.

-   [GroupMetric_Name].csv  
    The collected data by Group Metric are recorded into a different csv file for each Metric.

-   report.html  
    This file reports user configuration setting with a HTML format .

##### logs/archive directory

All the files in the logs directory except altimon.log, and *.csv are backed up into a archive/YYYY-MM-DD directory every day. 

Among above directories, the directories with expired maintenance period specified in are removed at 1:50am every day. 

##### logs/csv_backup directory

For Group Metrics, collected data(metric values) are constantly added to the same csv file unless the settings are modified. 

However, in case of the changed metric settings meaning that when the target objects in the group metric are changed, the existing csv file is backed up into the logs/csv_backup directory, and data are recorded in a new file with the identical name.

### altierr

#### About altierr

altierr searches for and displays detailed descriptions of Altibase server errors. Errors can be looked up using the error number, or a character string can be used as a search term and sought for within the error messages.

```
altierr {-w keyword pattern | [-n] error number}
```



#### Syntax

![](media/Utilities/altierr.gif)

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \-w       | Searches for error messages containing the specified search term. All error messages that contain the search term will be displayed. |
| \-n       | Searches for an error corresponding to the specified error code number. The error code number can be a hexadecimal number, a positive integer, or a negative integer. <br />Only the record that matches the error code number, if any, will be displayed. <br />When searching for an error using the error code number, the numeric parameter indicator (-n) can be safely omitted. |

#### Description

altierr searches the Altibase errors for strings that contain the specified error message or that match the specified error code number and displays the detailed description of any error that is found. The detailed description of the error includes the error code number, the error code string, the description, the cause of the error, and the action that the user must take in order  to remedy the error. When an error occurs, the Altibase server writes the corresponding error code to altibase_boot.log in the following format:

ERR-error code 

altierr can be used to search for the detailed description using either a hexadecimal or decimal error code, as shown below:

```
For ‘ERR-00015’
$ altierr 0x00015
$ altierr –w 00015
$ altierr 21
```

When SQL-related errors occur in applications written using the C/C++ precompiler or applications that use ODBC, the error code will be set in the SQLCODE variable, or will be returned by the ODBC function. In these cases, the error code will be a negative integer. To search for the description of the corresponding error, use altierr as follows:

```
For -266286
$ altierr -266286
$ altierr 266286
$ altierr 0x4102E
```

altierr can be used to search the text of error messages for a search term. In this case, multiple records may be returned. Use a character string as a search term for searching the text of error message descriptions as follows:

```
$ altierr –w connect
$ altierr –w “does not”
```

### altipasswd

#### About altipasswd

altipasswd changes the password of the SYS user, which is the user provided for accessing the database in SYSDBA mode.  

The password of the SYS user must be changed using both this utility and the ALTER USER SQL statement. If the password of the SYS user is changed using only the ALTER USER statement, an error will occur when SYSDBA tasks, such as starting up and shutting down the database, are performed.

```
altipasswd
```



#### Syntax

![](media/Utilities/altipasswd.gif)

#### Description

Changes the password of the SYS user.

#### Example

To change the password of the SYS user from “manager” to “manager1234”, type the following at a shell prompt:

```
$ altipasswd
Previous Password : manager
New Password : manager1234
Retype New Password : manager1234
```



### altiProfile

#### About altiProfile

Altibase can write information about tasks that are executed on the server and server status to files for analysis. A file that contains information about server status is called a profile. altiProfile can convert a profile to character format or print STATEMENT statistics. The user can analyze the system status with this information.

```
altiProfile [-stat query|session] {profile_name [profile_name2 [profile_name3] ...}
```

| 2     | [BIND]         | Whenever a SQL statement is executed, BIND parameter(s) is/are output. |
| 4     | [PLAN]         | Whenever a SQL statement is executed, the execution plan is output |
| 8     | [SESSION STAT] | Every 3 seconds, session information (i.e. the data in V$SESSTAT) is output. |
| 16    | [SYSTEM STAT]  | Every 3 seconds, system information (i.e. the data in V$SYSSTAT) is output. |
| 32    | [MEMORY STAT]  | Every 3 seconds, information about memory (i.e. the data in V$MEMSTAT) is output. |

The above values can be combined to log the desired information. For example, if the property is set to 1+4+32=37, then whenever a SQL statement is executed, the execution information and execution plan for the SQL statement are output, and additionally, information about memory is output every 3 seconds. 

If the QUERY_PROF_FLAG property is set to a nonzero value, the server will create and write to a profile file having a name that follows this convention:

##### Outputing Statistics

altiProfile can use the -stat option to build and out statistical information about executed SQL statements. This information helps you find the SQL statement to tune.

The -stat query option builds statistics on the following: 

-   COUNT: The number of times the query was executed.

-   AVG: The amount of time (in microseconds) the query took to execute, on average.

-   TOTAL: The amount of time (in microseconds) the query took to execute, in sum.

-   MIN: The minimum amount of time (in microseconds) the query took to execute.

-   MAX: The maximum amount of time (in microseconds) the query took to execute.

-   SUCCESS: The number of times the query succeeded.

-   FAIL: The number of times the query failed.

-   QUERY: The SQL statement that was executed.

When the -stat session option is used, SESSION ID is added to the statistics built using the query option.

The following is an example of altiProfile building statistics on SQL statements by analyzing profiles in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/trc directory.

```
$ altiProfile -stat query $ALTIBASE_HOME/trc/*.prof

### Processing [/altibase_home/trc/alti-1423543095-0.prof]...
100% [====================]

### Writing CSV File [alti-prof-stat-1423543711.csv]...

### Writing TEXT File [alti-prof-stat-1423543711.txt]...

### Successfully done.

```

In the example above, statistics are saved in text and CSV formats. The names of the files are automatically generated as 'alti-prof-stat-#time.csv' and 'alti-prof-stat-#time.txt'. 

The following is an example of a text file. Statistics are displayed in order under the column TOTAL. 

```
$cat alti-prof-stat-1423543711.txt
COUNT      AVG          TOTAL         MIN         MAX    SUCCESS  FAIL   QUERY
===========================================================================================================
     5     0.003730     0.018650     0.003035     0.004640     5     0    DROP VIEW REVENUE

...

```

The following is an example of a CSV file. The content displayed is the same as that of a text file, except that it is in CSV format. CSV format allows the user to move data between programs.

```
$ cat alti-prof-stat-1423543711.csv
COUNT,AVG,TOTAL,MIN,MAX,SUCCES,FAIL,QUERY
5,  0.003730,  0.018650,  0.003035,  0.004640,5,0,"DROP VIEW REVENUE"
5,  0.003523,  0.017616,  0.003004,  0.003745,5,0,"CREATE VIEW REVENUE (
...

```



#### Precaution

When the profiling function is activated, execution information is recorded for all SQL statements executed in the server, and the state of the server, such as session and system information, is recorded every 3 seconds. Therefore, the size of the profile file will increase rapidly, which could cause the disk to become full, consequently causing problems. So, care should be taken when considering whether to perform profiling. 

#### Output

Files are output in the follwing format.

### altiwrap

#### About altiwrap

altiwrap encrypts code programs written as persistent stored modules (PSMs). This utility prevents PSM code (e.g., stored procedures and stored functions) from being exposed. 

```
altiwarp {--iname input_file} [--oname output_file]
```



#### Syntax

![altiwrap](media/Utilities/altiwrap.gif)

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \-h/--h   | Prints help                                                  |
| \--iname  | Specifies the name of the file to encrypt. On omission of the extension, .sql is assumed. |
| \--oname  | Specifies the file name under which an encrypted code program is to be saved. On omission of the extension, it is saved as a .plb file. |

#### Description

altiwrap encrypts the code programs of stored procedures and stored functions to prevent them from being exposed. 

Altibase can encrypt the following statements. 

-   CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE

-   CREATE [OR REPLACE] FUNCTION

-   CREATE [OR REPLACE] TYPESET

-   CREATE [OR REPLACE] PACKAGE

-   CREATE [OR REPLACE] PACKAGE BODY

####  Considerations

-   Code programs cannot be modified after encryption. Changes must be made to the original code program, and then re-encrypted. 
-   Triggers cannot be encrypted. 
-   Encrypted code programs cannot be checked for syntax and semantic errors.

#### Example

Use altiwrap to encrypt the sample1.sql file, and then output it.

Create the sample1. sql file. 

```
iSQL> create or replace procedure proc1 as
type arr1 is table of char(30) index by integer;
v1 arr1;
begin
v1[0] := 'create or replace';
v1[1] := 'typeset';
v1[2] := 'is';
v1[3] := 'success';
println( v1[0] || v1[1] || v1[2] || v1[3] || '!' );
end;
/
```

Encrypt the file

```
$ altiwrap --iname sample1.sql --oname --sample1.plb
```

Run the encrypted file in iSQL.

```
iSQL> @sample1.plb
iSQL> create or replace procedure proc1 WRAPPED
'MjQz
MTk2
AAhjcmVhdGUgb3IgcmVwbGFjZSBwcm9jZWR1cqQBAAQxIGFzCnR5cGUgYXJyMSBpcyB0YWJsQAYAAWYgY2hhcigzMCkgaW5kZXggYnlAAQZ0ZWdlcjsKdjGYBQAEOwpiZWdpbgp2MVswXSA6PSAnY3JlYSu5ASdyBVsxtAN/DHNldK0CMq4CaXO5ATO4AQNzdWNjZXNsAgZwcmludGxuKCC2C3x8YAFACaABVAegAVwGDHx8ICchJyApOwplbmQ7ChEAADVBRDlBRkIzMDE0MzI1Q0U0MzY1RjYxNEI2NkYwQzRDREMzMTdDQTU=

Create success.
iSQL> exec proc1;
create or replace typeset is success!
Execute success.
```



### awrite

#### About awrite

Outputs the response time of the system call used to create the log file. The output value is used to determine the system call in the LOG_CREATE_METHOD property.

#### Syntax

![awrite](media/Utilities/awrite.gif)

#### Description

Outputs the response time of write () and fallocate () system calls.

#### Example

awrite outputs the following:

```
$ awrite
fallocate to expand file size to 1GB
 Elapsed Time ==>            2.564 seconds
write to expand file size to 1GB
 Elapsed Time ==>            4.020 seconds
```



### checkServer

#### About checkServer

Monitors the Altibase process and, if Altibase terminates, executes a script specified by a user.

```
checkServer [-n] {-f server-restart-script-file}
```



#### Syntax

![checkserver](media/Utilities/checkserver.gif)

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \-n       | Specifies that checkServer is to be executed in the foreground. If this parameter is omitted, checkServer will be executed in the background |
| \-f       | The name of the script file to be executed when Altibase terminates |

#### Description

checkServer periodically checks whether the Altibase process is running. If checkServer detects that Altibase has terminated, it executes the script specified by a user. It is common to set an Altibase restart script to be executed in the event of termination. Such a restart script can be written as follows:

-   The Altibase starup script 'restart.sh'

```
#! /bin/sh
${ALTIBASE_HOME}/bin/server start
```

When checkServer is executed, it creates the files checkServer.pid and checkServer.log in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/trc directory. checkServer.pid is a kind of lock that prevents another instance of checkServer from being started while the current instance is running. checkServer.log is used to regularly record the status of checkServer.

If checkServer is terminated abnormally, for example by using the command kill -9, the checkServer.pid file will not be deleted from the $ALTIBASE_HOME/trc directory. As long as this file remains in that directory, it will prevent checkServer from being executed again.

To terminate checkServer normally, use the killcheckServer utility

#### Note

checkServer executes the specified restart script only when the Altibase server is shut down without using the server stop command. When the Altibase server is shut down normally using server stop, checkServer is also terminated, and thus does not execute the restart script. That is, checkServer only considers shutdown using the server stop command to be a normal shutdown.

#### Example

checkServer is executed from a shell prompt as follows:

```
$ checkServer –f restart.sh &
```

#### Description

dumpdb analyzes memory checkpoint image files and outputs information of the meta header, page, etc. in text format, or outputs backup information from incremental backup files of the memory tablespace in text format.

Since this utility analyzes checkpoint image files stored on the disk, the user can view schemas created in the database, regardless of the status of the Altibase server. However, if the server is abnormally terminated after a DDL operation and this leads to the updated schema not being recorded on the disk, such information cannot be given.

#### Examples

At a shell prompt, type the following:

```
$ dumpdb -j 1
$ dumpdb -j 1 -s 0
$ dumpdb -j 2
$ dumpdb -j 3
$ dumpdb -j 4
$ dumpdb -j 4 -d
$ dumpdb -j 4 -o 65536
$ dumpdb -j 5 -o 65536
$ dumpdb -j 6 -s 0 -p 4
```

\<Example 1\> This example outputs information on the memory tablespace. By adding the -s suboption, information only regarding a certain tablespace can be output.

```
$ dumpdb -j 1
```

\<Example 2\> This example outputs information on the FreeListInfo(FLI) page of the memory tablespace. By adding the -s suboption, information only regarding a certain tablespace can be output; by adding the -d suboption, invalid contents of the FLI page can also be output.

```
% dumpdb -j 2
```

<Example 3> This example outputs the free pages of the memory tablespace. By adding the - s suboption, information only regarding a certain tablespace can be output.

```
% dumpdb -j 3
```

<Example 4> This example outputs information on all of the objects created in the database. By adding the -o suboption(the SelfOID in the example below), detailed information only regarding a certain object can be output; by adding the -d suboption, information on columns and indexes of the object can also be output.

```
% dumpdb -j 4
```

<Example 5> This example outputs information on all of the objects created in the database, along with information on columns and indexes.

```
% dumpdb -j 4 -d
```

<Example 6> This example outputs the schema and data of a certain table.

```
% dumpdb -j 4 -o 65568
```

\<Example 7\> This example outputs the list of pages that a certain table uses.

```
% dumpdb -j 5 -o 65568
```

\<Example 8\> This example outputs a certain page from the memory database.

```
% dumpdb –j 6 -s 0 -p 4
```

\<Example 9\> This example executes dumpdb on incremental backup files and outputs backup information.

### dumpla

#### About dumpla

ddumpla outputs the contents of loganchor files, which are saved in binary form, in the form of text. 

 Loganchor files contain information that is necessary in order to recover physically stored information (i.e. data files).When a database is created using the CREATE DATABASE statement, Altibase creates these files and stores them with the sequential names loganchor# (where “#” = 1, 2, or 3). Altibase stores these three files, which have the same contents, in the three respective directories specified using the LOGANCHOR_DIR property in altibase.properties. The reason that three files are maintained is to be prepared in the event that some of the files become lost or corrupt. These files contain information about all of the database's tablespaces and the data files stored in them, as well as recovery-related information. When the database is started, this information is used to load the database into memory and prepare to provide service.

```
dumpla <loganchor_file_name>
```



#### Syntax

![dumpla](media/Utilities/dumpla.gif)

#### Description

Outputs the content of a loganchor file in the form of text.

#### Example

At a shell prompt, type the following:

```
$ dumpla loganchor0
```



#### Output

dumpla displays the contents of a loganchor file in the following format:

### dumplf

#### ABout dumplf

When a transaction performs an operation that changes the contents of the database, such as an INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE operation, changes are made not only to the database's data buffers, but also to log files. These files are maintained for use in performing recovery if it becomes necessary. To minimize I/O, these logs are recorded in binary format. These log files are stored with the name logfile# (where “#” is the number of the log file, which continuously increments) in the directory specified in the LOG_DIR property in the altibase.properties file.

dumplf is a utility that converts and outputs the contents of these log files in text form. These logs can be used to check the types of operations that are performed on the database and determine the frequency of transactions that change the contents of the database.

```
dumplf {-f log_file_name} [-t transaction_id][-s] [-l][-S lsn [-F path] [-g]]
```

```



#### Output

The following is an example of dumplf output:

```
LSN=<0,820>, COMP:N, MAGIC:820, TID: 6400,BE: N, REP: Y, ISVP: N, ISVP_DEPTH: 0 PLSN=<0,739>, LT: SMR_LT_MEMTRANS_COMMIT, SZ: 45
```

Each field in a log file has the following meaning:다음과 같은 의미를 갖는다.

| Field Name              | Value                                                        | Description                                                  |

| LSN                     | Format: (FileNo, Offset) Offset range: From 0 (zero) to the maximum value of the unsigned int type | This is the log sequence number, which contains information about the physical location of the current log in a log file. The LSN consists of the identifier of the file number and an offset value. |
| COMP                    | Y\|N                                                         | Indicates whether logs are compressed. <br/>Y: Compressed N: Not compressed |
| MAGIC                   | From 0 (zero) to the maximum value of the unsigned short type | This value is generated using the log file number and offset portions of the LSN to determine whether a log record is valid. When a Redo or Undo action is performed, even if a log record having garbage data is in a log file, it is possible to determine whether the log record is valid. |
| TID                     | From 0 (zero) to the maximum value of the unsigned int type  | The identifier of the transaction                            |
| BE                      | Y\|N                                                         | Y: Indicates that the Sender must check whether to send this log to the Receiver. N: This log is not used by the replication Sender. |
| REP                     | Y\|N                                                         | Y: Indicates that the Sender must check whether to send this log to the Receiver. <br/>N: This log is not used by the replication Sender. |

### dumptrc 

#### About dumptrc

dumptrc outputs a trace log file recorded in $ALTIBASE_HOME/trc directory by converting into a format that a user can identify when the ALTIBASE HDB server is abnormally shut down.

```
dumptrc [-h |[-p file_path][-c [-s]]
[-a|-i file_name [-i file_name]..|-e file_name [-e file_name]..] [-n file_count] |-f |-v]
```



#### Syntax

![](media/Utilities/8d31776c2bc3e1d547efa1715f6899f7.png)

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \-h       | This outputs help. If the parameter is omitted or used as a duplicate with other parameter, the help would be preceding. |
| \-p       | This parameter specify the path brining a trace log file. Basically, if the path is not specified, a log file in $ALTIBASE_HOME/trc is retrieved. |
| \-c       | This parameter converts ALTIBASE process call stack recorded in altibase_error.log into a function name which a user can identify and return. Use -s option if you do not wish to convert the call stack address into a function name. Only the call stack is recorded if the parameter is used with -a, -i, -e, -n. |
| \-s       | This parameter outputs only the call stack recorded in a trace log and does not modify a function name. |
| \-a       | This parameter sorts and outputs all the trace log files.    |
| \-i       | This parameter outputs specific trace log files. Multiple log files can be output. However, this parameter cannot be used with -e parameter. |
| \-e       | This parameter outputs all files except a specified trace log file. Multiple log files cannot be repeatedly removed, and this parameter cannot be used with -i parameter. |
| \-n       | This parameter specifies the number of logs which will be output at once. 1 to 127 logs can be output and 10 logs are output unless otherwise specified. |
| \-f       | This parameter outputs a log message which is added whenever a trace log file is recorded. |
| \-v       | This parameter outputs dumptc version                        |

#### Description

The information of Altibase internal modules executed during Altibase termination is recorded in the process call stack. The module informaiton can be retrieved with dumptrc and retrievable trace log files can use the following files that are recorded into $ALTIBASE_HOME/trc.

-   ERROR : altibase_error.log

-   SERVER : altibase_boot.log

-   SM : altibase_sm.log

-   RP : altibase_rp.log

-   QP : altibase_qp.log

-   DK : altibase_dk.log

-   DR : altibase_dr.log

-   XA : altibase_xa.log

-   MM : altibase_mm.log

-   RP_CONFLICT : altibase_rp_conflict.log

-   DUMP : altibase_dump.log

-   TRC : altibase_trace.log

-   SNMP : altibase_snmp.log

-   CM : altibase_cm.log

-   MISC : altibase_misc.log

-   SD : altibase_sd.log

If outputting a trace log file located from a different path other than $ALTIBASE_HOME/trc, the path can be modified by using -p parameter. 

If experiencing abnormal termination of Altibase server, converts the process call stack into dumptrc and send it to Altibase technical service team so that the problem can be quickly solved.

#### Precaution

The version of Altibase executable file and that of the dumptrc should be identical to confirm the call stack information in order to normally operate the dumptrc.

#### Examples

<Example 1>  altibase_error.log and altibase_boot.log are bound to output

```

### killCheckServer

#### About killCheckServer

killCheckServer terminates the checkServer utility if it is currently running.

```
killCheckServer
```



#### Syntax

![killcheckserver](media/Utilities/killcheckserver.gif)

#### Description

killCheckServer terminates the checkServer utility if it is currently running.

If the server stop or server kill command was issued to stop the Altibase server, the server script terminates checkServer process by executing this utility before terminating the Altibase instance. In that case, the following results of killCheckServer execution will be recorded in the killCheckServer.log file under the $ALTIBASE_HOME/trc directory:

- When checkServer is running:

```
checkServer killed.
```


- When checkServer is not running: 

```
ERROR CODE : -27
```


If the user executes the killCheckServer command directly, then the result will not be recorded in the file.

#### Example

At a shell prompt, enter the following:

```
$ killCheckServer
```



### server

#### Description

iSQL is used to execute SQL statements for creating, starting up and shutting down Altibase. These frequently used commands have been combined and provided in the form of the server shell script for the convenience of DBAs.

The server script includes the following functionalities:

-   Starting up the Altibase process 
-   Shutting down the Altibase process 
-   Restarting the Altibase process 
-   Forcibly terminating the Altibase process 
-   Displaying the result of querying “SELECT * from TAB;” 
-   Creating an Altibase 
-   Starting the Altibase process as the role manager

For more information about using SQL to manage Altibase databases, please refer to the *SQL Reference*. For more detailed information on the role manager, please refer to the *Disaster Recovery Manual.* 

#### Examples

The server shell command is used as follows:

```
$ server start
$ server restart
$ server stop
$ server status
$ server kill
$ server create ksc5601 utf16
$ server startRoleManager
$ server stopRoleManager
```
