## 7. SQL Functions

--------

### Introduction to SQL Functions

SQL functions are built into Altibase, and are available for use in various SQL statements. In addition to the built-in SQL functions, it is also possible for the user to define stored functions. For more information, please refer to the *Stored Procedures Manual.*

 If a SQL function is called and an argument having a data type other than the data type expected by the SQL function is provided, then Altibase attempts to convert the argument to the expected data type before executing the SQL function. If an argument having a NULL value is provided when calling a SQL function, then the SQL function returns NULL. 

This section lists the SQL functions that are supported in Altibase and explains how they are classified.

#### Classifying SQL Functions

SQL functions can be broadly classified into the categories set forth in the following table.

| Category                              | Description and Functions                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Aggregate functions                   | The aggregate functions return a single value as a result of processing multiple rows. They can be used in select_list, ORDER BY, and HAVING clauses.<br />**The aggregate functions**<br/>AVG, CORR, COUNT, COVAR_POP, COVAR_SAMP, CUME_DIST, FIRST, GROUP_CONCAT, LAST, LISTAGG, MAX, MIN, PERCENTILE_CONT, PERCENTILE_DISC, PERCENT_RANK, RANK, STATS_ONE_WAY_ANOVA, STDDEV, STDDEV_POP, STDDEV_SAMP, SUM, VARIANCE, VAR_POP, VAR_SAMP |
| Window functions (Analytic Functions) | The window functions calculate aggregate values based on groups of rows.

### Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions process multiple rows and return a single resultant value. Aggregate functions can be used in the SELECT list and in the ORDER BY and HAVING clauses. 

If a SELECT statement contains a GROUP BY clause, then only constants, aggregate functions, the expressions in the GROUP BY clause, and expressions that are based on the foregoing can be specified in the SELECT list.

#### AVG

##### Syntax

```
AVG ( [ALL | DISTINCT] expression)
```



##### Description

This function calculates the average of the input expressions. NULL values are excluded from the calculation. The function returns a FLOAT type value.

##### Example

\<Query\>  Calculate and display the average price in the goods table.

```
iSQL> SELECT AVG(price) FROM goods;
AVG(PRICE)  
--------------
30406.173   
1 row selected.
```



#### CORR

##### Syntax 

```
CORR (expr1, expr2) OVER {...}
```



##### Description

This function calculates the coefficient of correlation of inserted expr1 and expr2. The result would be greater than or equal to -1 , and smaller than or equal to 1. As the result goes nearer to 0, the coefficient of correlation would be smaller, however, if it gets closer to +1, the coefficient of correlation would be much deeper. The return type is DOUBLE, and variables should be calculated by converting with DOUBLE.

The CORR function can be used as an aggregate functions and an analytic function.

##### Example

\<Query\> Calculate the coefficient of correlation between the employee number and salary.

```
iSQL> SELECT CORR(ENO,SALARY) FROM employees;
CORR(ENO,SALARY)
-------------------------
-0.02180715597157
1 row selected.
```



#### COUNT

##### Syntax

```
COUNT ( [ * | [ALL | DISTINCT] expression ] )
```



##### Description

COUNT returns the number of rows returned by the query. NULL values are not counted.

##### Examples

\<Query\>  Display the number of records in the employees table.

```
iSQL> SELECT COUNT(*) Rec_count FROM employees;
REC_COUNT            
-----------------------
20                   
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\> Display the number of birthday tables in the table employees.

```
iSQL> SELECT COUNT(birth) Rec_count 
    FROM employees;
REC_COUNT            
-----------------------
13                   
1 row selected.
```



#### COVAR_SAMP

##### Syntax 

```
COVAR_SAMP (expr1, expr2) OVER {...}
```



##### Description

Calculate the sample covariance of inserted expr1 and expr2. If an input value rises along with another value, the result would be positive numbers, but if another value falls while the input value rises, the result would be negative numbers. The return type is DOUBLE, and variables should be calculated by converting the variables with DOUBLE.

The COVAR_SAMP function can be used as an aggregate a function and analytic function.

##### Example

\<Query\> Calculate the sample voariance of employees number and salary.

```
iSQL> SELECT COVAR_SAMP(ENO,SALARY) FROM employees;
COVAR_SAMP(ENO,SALARY)
-------------------------
-95.0698529411784
1 row selected.
```



#### COVAR_POP

##### Syntax

```
COVAR_POP (expr1, expr2) OVER {...}
```



##### Description

This function is used to calculate the population covariance of inserted expr1 and expr2. If an input value rises along with another value, the result would be positive numbers, but if another value falls while the input value rises, the result would be negative numbers. The return type is DOUBLE, and variables should be calculated by converting the variables with DOUBLE. 

The COVAR_POP function can be used as an aggregate function and an analytic function.

##### Example

\<Query\> Calculate the population covariance of the employee number and salary

```
iSQL> SELECT COVAR_POP(ENO,SALARY) FROM employees;
COVAR_POP(ENO,SALARY)
-------------------------
-89.4775086505208
1 row selected.
```



#### CUME_DIST

##### Syntax

![cume_dist_with_group](media/SQL/cume_dist_with_group.gif)

[window_order_clause::=](#window_order_clause)

##### Description

The CUME_DIST function calculates the accumulative distribution of a group of values that are lined up based on a result set (or partitions) in particular. The return value is greater than 0 or less than 1.

> Note: The number of arguments in the CUME_DIST and that of the WITHIN GROUP clause should be corresponding one another, but the argument type is not automatically compatible. Also, the data type of CUME_DIST argument is not restricted; however, using a constant is recommended.

##### Example

\<Query\> Confirm the accumulative distribution of SALARY by using the CUME_DIST function.

```
iSQL> select SALARY from EMPLOYEES ORDER BY 1;

Because error can accumulate when using system calls to perform repeated operations on real numbers, the return value may have some amount of inherent tolerance (error).

##### Example

\<Query\>  Calculate the standard deviation of the wages in the employees table.

```
iSQL> SELECT STDDEV(salary) standard_deviation 
  FROM employees;
STANDARD_DEVIATION
-------------------------

##### Syntax

```
STDDEV_POP (expression)
```



##### Description

The STDDEV_POP returns the standard deviation of all rows which are not NULL of input expression. 

NULL is returned when the number of row is less than 1 which is not NULL. There might be an error in the return value due to accumulation of repetitive computing error by a system call.

##### Example

\<Query\> Calculate the standard deviation of wages in the employees table.

```
iSQL> SELECT STDDEV_POP(salary) FROM employees;
STDDEV_POP(SALARY)
-------------------------
773.889256492736
1 row selected.
```



#### STDDEV_SAMP

##### Syntax

```
STDDEV_SAMP ([ALL | DISTINCT] expression)
```



##### Description

The STDDEV_SAMP returns the sample standard deviation of all rows which are not NULL of input expression. 

NULL is returned when the number of row, which is not NULL, is less than 2. 

There might be an error in the return value due to the accumulaion of repetitive computing error by a system call.

##### Example

\<Query\>  Calculate the sample standard deviation of wages in the table employees.

```
iSQL> SELECT STDDEV_SAMP(salary) FROM employees;
STDDEV_SAMP(SALARY)
-------------------------

SUM returns the result of addition of the input expressions.

##### Example

\<Query\>  Calculate the total number of items stored using the table goods.

```
iSQL> SELECT SUM(stock) FROM goods;
SUM(STOCK)           
-----------------------
379420               
1 row selected.
```



#### VARIANCE

##### Syntax

```
VARIANCE ([ALL | DISTINCT] expression)
```



##### Description

VARIANCE returns the variance of the input expressions.

Because error can accumulate when using system calls to perform repeated operations on real numbers, the return value may have some amount of inherent tolerance (error).

##### Example

\<Query\> Calculate the variance of the wages in the table employees.

```
iSQL> SELECT VARIANCE(salary) variance 
  FROM employees;
VARIANCE
-------------------------
636336.117647059
```



#### VAR_POP

##### Syntax

```
VAR_POP (expression)
```



##### Description

The VAR_POP returns population variance of all rows which are not NULL of input expression. 

NULL is returned when the number of row is less than 1. 

There might be an error in the return value due to accumulation of repetitive computing error by a system call.

##### Example

\<Query\> Calculate the population standard deviation of wages in the table employees

```
iSQL> SELECT VAR_POP(salary) FROM employees;
VAR_POP(SALARY)
-------------------------
598904.581314879

The VAR_SAMP returns the sample variance of all rows which are not NULL of input expression.

NULL is returned when the number of row is less than 2. 

There might be an error in the return value due to accumulation of repetitive computing error by a system call

##### Example

\<Query\> Calculate the sample standard deviation of wages in the table employees.

```
iSQL> SELECT VAR_SAMP(salary) FROM employees;
VAR_SAMP(SALARY)
-------------------------

### Window (Analytic) Functions

Commonly known as analytic functions, window functions(ANSI/ISO SQL standard uses the term window functions) calculate aggregate values based on groups of rows. Window functions(or analytic functions) are similar to regular aggregate functions in the sense that they operate on multiple numbers of rows or groups of rows within result sets returned by queries. However, the groups of rows that window functions operate on are defined by the PARTITION BY and the ROWS/RANGE subclause nested in the OVER clause, rather than by the GROUP BY clause. Order within these groups is also decided by the ORDER BY subclause nested in the OVER clause, rather than by the ORDER BY clause of the main query.

In this section, the group divided by the PARTITION BY subclause will be called a “partition”, and the group divided by the ROWS/RANGE subclause will be called a “window”.

Altibase version 6.3.1 onwards supports the following window functions:

-   Aggregate window functions: AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, STDDEV, SUM, VARIANCE,
    GROUP_CONCAT, RATIO_TO_REPORT

-   Ranking window functions: RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LAG, LEAD, NTILE

-   Row order-related window functions: FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE, NTH_VALUE

Aggregate window functions execute the calculation of the sum or average of the column values within a partition. Altibase supports the use of all aggregate functions listed in the “Aggregate Function” section as window functions (except CUME_DIST, PERCENT_RANK). Aggregate functions generally return one result row per group; when used as window functions, however, values are returned per row.

Ranking window functions return the order value of each row within a partition. Functions of this type require the ORDER BY subclause nested in the OVER clause. 

Functions associated with row order search for the first or last value within an ordered partition set or the preceding or following value within a particular set. 

Descriptions on other functions other than aggregate functions are provided in the following section.

#### Description

Analytic functions can only appear in a SELECT list or in an ORDER BY clause. 

The steps taken when processing queries containing analytic functions are as follows:

-   Step 1: The query is processed, with the exception of any window functions and the ORDER BY clause (if present). 
-   Step 2: If any window functions contain the PARTITION BY subclause, the query results of Step 1 are divided into partitions on which the window functions are to be executed. 
-   Step 3: If an ORDER BY expression is present, the results are ordered for each of the partitions. 
-   Step 4: If the ROWS/RANGE clause is present, the window frame is decided. 
-   Step 5: The window functions are executed. 
-   Step 6: If an ORDER BY clause is present, it is processed.

*window_function*

This specifies the name for the function to be used as a window function.

*arg_expr*

This specifies expressions to be used as arguments for the window function.

*IGNORE NULLS*

When this function is used, it will return the values excluding NULL values.

*OVER window_specificatoin*

OVER is a keyword that instructs the query processor that this function will operate on a queried result set. 

Window functions that include this clause can be specified by the SELECT list or the ORDER BY clause. 

For all window functions used in the select list of a query, the OVER clause follows. The OVER clause decides how to divide and order a result set for window function execution. After the OVER keyword, the following three subclauses that specify division and sort policies may follow:

*window_partition_clause*

This clause specifies one or more expressions or columns as the criteria for merging queried result sets into groups (partitions). All window functions support this clause; its use is optional. On omission, window functions process the overall result set as one partition.

If aggregate-related functions use this clause in the absence of the ORDER BY subclause, the DISTINCT keyword can be used as a function argument.

*window_order_clause*

This clause specifies one or more expressions or columns as the criterion for ordering data within a partition. The use of this clause is optional for aggregate functions; for ranking functions, however, its use is mandatory.

For aggregate-related functions, the DISTINCT keyword cannot be used as a function argument with this clause.

With the NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST keyword, the window_order_clause can be used to position NULL at the beginning or end of the order.

*window_frame_clause*

This clause defines a row-based window (a set of physical or logical rows) on which functions are to be operated; functions apply to all rows within the window. A window traverses queried result sets or partitions from top to bottom.

ROWS specifies a window based on the number of rows and RANGE specifies a window based on row values. Refer to the following examples:

-   RANGE BETWEEN 50 PRECEDING AND 150 FOLLOWING  
    All rows corresponding to (current row value - 50) and (current row value + 150) within the partition are defined as a window.
    
-   ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING  
    The row preceding the current row and the row following it within the partition are included in the definition of a window
    
-   RANGE UNBOUNDED PRECEDING  
    The current row up to the first row within the partition are defined as a window.

-   ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING  
    The first row down to the last row within the partition are defined as a window.

Ranking-related functions cannot use this clause; its use is optional for aggregate-related functions. For row ranking-related functions, its use is optional - however, it would be pointless to execute the function without using this clause.

The ORDER BY subclause is mandatory in order to specify this clause. If this clause is included, the DISTINCT keyword cannot be used as a window function argument. 

If ROWS/RANGE clauses are not specified while using window functions that support ROWS/RANGE clauses, the default value is 'RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW'. 

Only positive integers are accepted for value; expressions are not accepted. 

If a DATE type expression is used in an ORDER BY subclause of a window function, the following forms can come at value of the RANGE clause:

```
INTERVAL n [YEAR | MONTH | DAY | HOUR | MINUTE | SECOND]
```



#### DENSE_RANK

##### Syntax

```
DENSE_RANK () OVER {...}
```



##### Description

Like the RANK function, this function assigns rankings based on a certain members of a result set or partition. However, DENSE_RANK does not leave a gap in the sequence after the occurrence of duplicate values. The return value type is BIGINT.

#### FIRST_VALUE

##### Syntax

```
FIRST_VALUE (expr) OVER {...}
```



##### Description

This function obtains the value of the first row within a partition or window.

##### Limitations

-   The DISTINCT keyword cannot be used as the function argument. 
-   The OVER clause is mandatory.

#### FIRST_VALUE_IGNORE_NULLS

##### Syntax

```
FIRST_VALUE_IGNORE_NULLS (expr) OVER {...}
```



##### Description

This function obtains the value of the first row excluding NULL values within a partition or window.

##### Limitations

Same as the FIRST_VALUE function.

#### LAG

##### Syntax

```
LAG (expr [, offset [, default_value]]) OVER {...}
```



##### Description

This function obtains the value of the row at the given physical offset preceding the current row within each ordered partition. Only positive integers are accepted for *offset*; on omission, the default value is 1. For rows that exceed the specified *offset* within the partition, default_value is applied. On *default_value* omission, the default value is NULL.

##### Limitation

-   The DISTINCT keyword cannot be used as a function argument. 
-   The ORDER BY subclause must be present within the OVER clause. 
-   Only positive integers are accepted for *offset*

#### LAG_IGNORE_NULLS

##### Syntax

```
LAG_IGNORE_NULLS (expr [, offset [, default_value]]) OVER {...}
```



##### Description

This function obtains the first value (excluding NULL) of the row at the given physical *offset* preceding the current row within each ordered partition. Only positive integers are accepted for offset; on omission, the default value is 1. For rows that exceed the specified offset within the partition, *default_value* is applied. On *default_value* omission, the default value is NULL.

##### Limitation

Same as the LAG function.

#### LAST_VALUE

##### Syntax

```
LAST_VALUE (expr) OVER {...}
```



##### Description

This function obtains the value of the last row within a partition or window.

##### Limitations

-   The DISTINCT keyword cannot be used as a function argument. 
-   The OVER clause is mandatory.

#### LAST_VALUE_IGNORE_NULLS

##### Syntax

```
LAST_VALUE_IGNORE_NULLS (expr) OVER {...}
```



##### Description

This function obtains the value of the last row excluding NULL values within a partition or window.

##### Limitation

Same as the LAST_VALUE function.

#### LEAD

##### Syntax

```
LEAD (expr [, offset [, default_value]]) OVER {...}
```



##### Description

This function obtains the value of the row at the given physical *offset* following the current row within each ordered partition. Only positive integers are accepted for offset ; on omission, the default value is 1. For rows that exceed the specified offset, *default_ value* is applied. On *default_value* omission, the default value is NULL.

##### Limitations

-   The DISTINCT keyword cannot be used as a function argument. 
-   The ORDER BY subclause must be present within the OVER clause. 
-   Only positive integers are accepted for offset.

#### LEAD_IGNORE_NULLS

##### Syntax

```
LEAD_IGNORE_NULLS (expr [, offset [, default_value]]) OVER {...}
```



##### Description

This function obtains the first value (excluding NULL) of the row at the given physical offset following the current row within each ordered partition. Only positive integers are accepted for offset ; on omission, the default value is 1. For rows that exceed the specified *offset*, *default_ value* is applied. On *default_value* omission, the default value is NULL.

##### Limitation

Same as the LEAD function

#### LISTAGG

##### Syntax

![listagg](media/SQL/listagg.gif)

##### Description

LISTAGG converts column values that correspond to *exp* as a column, in the order specified for *order_by_clause. arg* separates the returned string; on omission, the string is not separated. 

LISTAGG can be used as aggregate and analytic functions. 

##### Example

\<Query\> The following example uses LISTAGG as an aggregate function. Print name from table emp, grouped by empno, in the order of job. Separate each name with a semicolon(;).

#### PERCENTILE_CONT

##### Syntax 

![percentile_cont](media/SQL/percentile_cont.gif)

##### Description 

PERCENTILE_CONT is an inverse distribution function based on a continuous distribution model, which sorts values and returns a value corresponding to the specified percentile value. This function returns a FLOAT data type and ignores nulls. 

*expr1* is a constant between 0 and 1; *expr1* cannot be a NUMERIC data type. 

PERCENTILE_CONT can be used as aggregate and analytic functions. 

##### Examples

\<Query\> The following example uses PERCENTILE_CONT as an aggregate function. Print the median salary for *empno* from the table *emp*.

```
iSQL> select empno, 
 percentile_cont(0.5) within group (order by sal asc) "median asc cont",

#### PERCENTILE_DISC

##### Syntax 

![percentile_disc](media/SQL/percentile_disc.gif)

##### Description

PERCENTILE_DISC is an inverse distribution function based on a discrete distribution model, which sorts values and returns a value corresponding to the specified percentile value. This function returns a FLOAT data type and ignores nulls. 

*expr1* is a constant between 0 and 1; *expr1* cannot be a NUMERIC data type. 

PERCENTILE_DISC can be used as aggregate and analytic functions. 

##### Examples

\<Query\> The following example uses PERCENTILE_DISC as an aggregate function. Print the median salary for *empno* from the table *emp*. Whereas PERCENTILE_CONT returns the average of two middle values for an even number of groups, PERCENTILE_DISC returns the first of the two middle values.

```
iSQL> select empno, 
 percentile_disc(0.5) within group (order by sal asc) "median asc cont",
 percentile_disc(0.5) within group (order by sal desc) "median desc cont"
 from emp 
 group by empno; 
EMPNO median asc cont median desc cont

#### RANK

##### Syntax

![rank_with_group](media/SQL/rank_with_group.gif)

[window_order_clause::=](#window_order_clause)

##### Description

The RANK function calculates and determines the ranking based upon particular members of a result set or partitions. The identical values are equally ranked. To that extent, raking is skipped, then the following rank is determined. The type of return value is BIGINT. Also, the RANK function can be used as an aggregate and analytical functions.

> Note : The number of arguments of RANK and that of the WITHIN GROUP should be identical, and the type of arguments are not compatible each other. Even though there is no restriction on the data type of RANK argument; however, a constant is not suggested for using. 

##### Example

\<Query\> Display the rank of the employees with DNO of 1003 and SALARY of 1001.

```
iSQL> select DNO, SALARY from EMPLOYEES ORDER BY 1,2;
DNO         SALARY
---------------------------
1001        2000
1001        2300
1002        980

1003        1000
1003        2003
1003        2750
1003        4000
2001        1400
3001        1800

#### RATIO_TO_REPORT

##### Syntax

![ratio_to_report](media/SQL/ratio_to_report.gif)

[window_partition_clause::=](#window_partition_clause)

##### Description

The RATIO_TO_REPORT function calculates the ratio of expr inserted based upon particular buckets of partitions. If null is inserted, the null is returned, and if the window_partition_clause statement is omitted, the ratio is calculated based on all the returning rows.

##### Example

\<Query\> Confirm the ratio of employee salary in each department.

```
iSQL> select E_FIRSTNAME, DNO, SALARY, RATIO_TO_REPORT(SALARY) OVER (PARTITION BY DNO) AS Result from EMPLOYEES LIMIT 9;
E_FIRSTNAME           DNO         SALARY      RESULT
---------------------------------------------------------------
Ken                   1001        2000        0.465116279

Jason                 1003        1000        0.102532554
Takahiro              2001        1400        1
9 rows selected.
```



#### ROW_NUMBER

##### Syntax

```
ROW_NUMBER () OVER {...}
```



##### Description

The ROW_NUMBER function sequentially assigns unique numbers based on the members of a result set or partition. The numbers are assigned starting from 1 in the order determined by the ORDER BY expression. 

If duplicate values exist in the result set, the order in which the row numbers are assigned to the duplicate values cannot be guaranteed. If there is a need to guarantee the order in which the row numbers are assigned, use an ORDER BY clause that references some other column. The return value type is BIGINT.

##### Examples

\<Query\> Rank the employees in each department by salary in decreasing order.

```
iSQL(sysdba)> SELECT e_lastname, dno, salary, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dno ORDER BY salary DESC) FROM employees;
E_LASTNAME            DNO         SALARY      RANK

#### DIGITS

##### Syntax

```
DIGITS (n)
```



##### Description

This returns an integer as a character string.

The length of the character string depends on the data type (or size) of n. A string comprising 5 digits is returned for a SMALLINT, 10 digits for an INTEGER, and 19 digits for a BIGINT. If the number of digits in the input value is less than the number of digits that can be stored in the numeric data type, the leading spaces are populated with 0's (zeroes).

##### Example

\<Query\> Output a character string for each of three input numbers having different numeric data types. The length of the string is set differently for each data type.

```
CREATE TABLE T1 (I1 SMALLINT, I2 INTEGER, I3 BIGINT);
NSERT INTO T1 VALUES (357, 12, 5000);

iSQL> SELECT DIGITS(I1), DIGITS(I2), DIGITS(I3) FROM T1;
DIGITS(I1)  DIGITS(I2)  DIGITS(I3)           
------------------------------------------------
00357  0000000012  0000000000000005000  
1 row selected.
```



#### INITCAP

##### Syntax

```
INITCAP (expr)
```



##### Description

INITCAP converts the first character in each word in the input character expression to uppercase and returns the result. Words are delimited by spaces or by characters that are not letters or numbers.

##### Example

\<Query\> Output the character string “the soap” after converting the first letter in each word to uppercase.

```
iSQL> SELECT INITCAP ('the soap') Capital FROM dual;
CAPITAL   
------------
The soap  
1 row selected.
```



#### INSTR, INSTRB, POSITION

##### Syntax

```
INSTR (expr, substring [, start [, occurrence]])
INSTRB (expr, substring [,start [, occurrence]])
POSITION (expr, substring [,start [, occurrence]])
```

##### Description

The INSTR function looks for substring in expr and returns the location of the first character in *substring* if *substring* is found. It returns 0 (zero) if substring is not found. The INSTRB function returns the position of the specified string in bytes rather than in characters. 

*start* specifies the position in *expr* at which the search begins. The default start value is 1, i.e. the first character. If a negative start value is specified, the search begins the specified number of characters from the end of *expr*. If a start value of 0 (zero) is specified, the function simply returns 0 (zero). If the value of *start* is greater than the length of *expr*, an error will occur. 

*occurrence* indicates the instance of *substring* in *expr* for which to return the position. The default value is 1. If occurrence is set to 1, the position of the first instance of *substring* that is found will be returned; if it is set to 2, the position of the second instance of *substring* will be returned; etc. If it is set to 0 (zero) or to a value that is greater than the number of times that *substring* is found in expr, 0 (zero) will be returned. If it is set to a negative value, an error will occur. POSITION has the same function as INSTR. This function is case-sensitive..

##### Examples

\<Query\>  Return the position of the second occurrence of “OR” in the string “CORPORATE FLOOR”, beginning the search at the third character.

```
iSQL> SELECT INSTR ('CORPORATE FLOOR','OR', 3, 2)  Instring FROM dual;
INSTRING    
--------------
14          
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\> Return the position of the second occurrence of “베이” in the string “알티베이스5 데이터베이스“, beginning the search at the third character. (Note that the character set is KO16KSC5601.)

```
iSQL> SELECT INSTR ('알티베이스5 데이터베이스','베이', 3, 2)  Instring FROM dual;
INSTRING    
--------------
11          
1 row selected.
```



#### LOWER

##### Syntax

```
LOWER (expr)
```



##### Description

LOWER returns the input string with all letters converted to lowercase.

##### Example

\<Query\> Convert the input string into lowercase letters and output it.

```
iSQL> SELECT LOWER('ONE PAGE PROPOSAL') Lowercase FROM dual;
LOWERCASE          
---------------------
one page proposal  
1 row selected.
```



#### LPAD

##### Syntax

```
LPAD (expr1, n [,expr2])
```



##### Description

LPAD pads the left of *expr1* with the sequence of characters in *expr2*, repeatedly if necessary, until the resultant string is n characters long. If *expr2* is not specified, then *expr1* is padded with blank spaces. If *expr1* is longer than n, this function simply returns the leftmost n characters of *expr1*.

Note that n is the number of characters, not bytes, and thus the number of bytes in the string may vary depending on the respective characters set that are in use on the server and the client (NLS_USE).

##### Example

\<Query\>  Pad the left of the character string “abc” with “xyz” and return a total of 10 characters.

```
iSQL> SELECT LPAD('abc', 10, 'xyz') Lpad_ex FROM dual;
LPAD_EX     
------------------------------------------------
xyzxyzxabc  
1 row selected.
```



#### LTRIM

##### Syntax

```
LTRIM (expr1 [,expr2])
```



##### Description

LTRIM compares each of the characters in *expr1* with each of the characters in *expr2*, starting from the leftmost character in *expr1*. If any of the characters in *expr2* is the same as the current character in *expr1*, that character is deleted from *expr1*. This process occurs repeatedly until none of the characters in *expr2* match the current character in expr1, at which point the current character in *expr1* (i.e the first character without a match in *expr2*) is output along with all subsequent characters. 

The default value for *expr2* is a single blank. Therefore, if *expr2* is omitted, blank spaces are trimmed from the left of *expr1.*

##### Example

\<Query\>  Trim all occurrences of the letters “a” and “b” from the beginning of the string “abaAabLEFT TRIM” and output the result.

```
iSQL> SELECT LTRIM ('abaAabLEFT TRIM', 'ab') Ltrim_ex FROM dual; 
LTRIM_EX         
-------------------
AabLEFT TRIM     
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\>  Retrieve the month that each employee joined the company by removing the leading day information and the hyphen between the day and month.

#### NCHR

##### Syntax

```
NCHR (n)
```



##### Description

NCHR returns the character corresponding to the value of n in the national character set. The return value is of type NVARCHAR.

##### Example

<Query\> Output the 187th (U+00BB) character in the national character set.

```
iSQL> SELECT NCHR(187) FROM DUAL;
NC
--
>>
1 row selected.
```



#### OCTET_LENGTH, LENGTHB

##### Syntax

```
OCTET_LENGTH (expr)
```



##### Description

OCTET_LENGTH returns the size, in bytes, of the input character string. 

The number of bytes in the input character string can vary depending on the database character set and the national character set of the database. 

LENGTHB has the same function as OCTET_LENGTH

##### Examples

\<Query\>  Output the length, in bytes, assigned to the character string '우리나라'. (Note that the database character set in this case has been set to K016KSC5601.) 

```
iSQL> SELECT OCTET_LENGTH('우리나라') FROM dual;
OCTET_LENGTH('우리나라') 
---------------------------
8           
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\>  Return the lengths, in bytes, of the addresses in the managers table.

```
iSQL> SELECT OCTET_LENGTH(address) 
FROM managers;
OCTET_LENGTH(ADDRESS) 
------------------------
32          
18          
2 rows selected.
```



#### PKCS7PAD16

##### Syntax

```
PKCS7PAD16 (expr)
```



##### Description

PKCS7PAD16 adjusts the total byte length of expr to a multiple of 16. This function is helpful when using encryption or decryption functions which only accept strings that are a multiple of 8 or 16 in length. 

The padding rule for adjusting the input data length to a multiple of 16 is as follows:

-   For strings whose length is shorter than a multiple of 16 : the end of the string is padded with characters so that the total string length is a multiple of 16. For example, four "0x04" characters are padded to a string which requires four more bytes.
-   For strings whose length is a multiple of 16: the end of the string is padded with the "0x10(16)" character.

##### Example

Please refer to the examples for AESDECRYPT.

#### PKCS7UNPAD16

##### Syntax

```
PKCS7UNPAD16 (expr)
```



##### Description

PKCS7UNPAD16 removes the trailing characters from a byte string whose length was padded to a multiple of 16 with the PKCS7PAD16() function, and returns it as it was. However, if expr does not comply with the padding rule of the PKCS7PAD16 function, an error occurs. 

This function is helpful when using encryption or decryption functions which only accept strings that are a multiple of 8 or 16 in length.

##### Example

Please refer to the examples for AESDECRYPT.

#### RANDOM_STRING

##### Syntax

```
RANDOM_STRING (option, length)
```



##### Description

This function generates a random string in the format specified in option and of as many characters as specified in length. The return type is VARCHAR.

*length* specifies the length of the random string to be created, and can take a value from 0~4000. option can take one of the following parameters:

-   'u', 'U' : generates a random string in upper case alphabetic characters 
-   'l', 'L' : generates a random string in lower case alphabetic characters 
-   'a', 'A' : generates a random string in case-insensitive alphabetic characters
-   'x', 'X' : generates a random string in upper case alphanumeric characters 
-   'p', 'P' : generates a random string in any printable characters

##### Example

\<Query\>

```
iSQL> SELECT RANDOM_STRING( 'U', 10 ) from dual;
RANDOM_STRING( 'U', 10 )
---------------------------
BCJVFUMXPK

#### REGEXP_COUNT

##### Syntax

```
REGEXP_COUNT (expr, pattern_expr[, start])
```



##### Description

REGEXP_COUNT returns the number of occurrences of *pattern_expr* in the *expr* string, from the *start* position. 

*pattern_expr* is the regular expression patten to be searched for, and can contain up to 1024 bytes. If expr and pattern_expr are of different data types, *pattern_expr* is converted to the datatype of expr. 

*start* is the position at which the search is to begin, and takes the value of a positive integer other than 0. If this value is omitted, the default value is 1, and the search begins at the first character of the input *expr* string. 

*pattern_expr* can be a value that expresses the search patten as a regular expression. For further information on regular expressions, please refer to ”Appendix A. Regular Expressions”.

##### Example

\<Query\> Search the expression 'Guro' from the beginning of the input string, and output the number of times the expression occurs.

```
iSQL> SELECT 
REGEXP_COUNT('Daerungpost-Tower II Guro-3 Dong, Guro-gu Seoul',
'Guro', 1) "REGEXP_COUNT"
FROM DUAL;
REGEXP_COUNT
---------------
2
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\> Search the input string from the beginning for substrings without blank characters, and output the number of times it occurs.

```
iSQL> SELECT
        REGEXP_COUNT('Daerungpost-Tower II Guro-3 Dong, Guro-gu Seoul',
       '[^ ]+', 1) "REGEXP_COUNT"
       FROM DUAL;
REGEXP_COUNT
---------------
6
1 row selected.
```



#### REGEXP_INSTR

##### Syntax

```
REGEXP_INSTR (expr, pattern_expr [, start [, occurrence]])
```



##### Description

REGEXP_INSTR is a function which extends the functionality of the INSTR function. 

REGEXP_INSTR differs from INSTR in that it takes a regular expression pattern (instead of the search string) as the second argument, and that *start* only accepts a positive integer. *pattern_expr* can contain up to 1024 bytes. Other arguments are equivalent for both functions; please refer to the descriptions for the 7.5.7 INSTR, INSTRB, POSITION. 

*pattern_expr* can be a value that expresses the search patten as a regular expression. For further information on regular expressions, please refer to ”Appendix A. Regular Expressions”.

##### Example

\<Query\>  The following example searches the string for occurrences of substrings without blank characters. The beginning position of the fifth occurrence of a substring without a blank character is output.

```
iSQL> SELECT 
REGEXP_INSTR('Daerungpost-Tower II Guro-3 Dong, Guro-gu Seoul',
'[^ ]+', 1, 5) "REGEXP_INSTR"
FROM DUAL;
REGEXP_INSTR
---------------
35
1 row selected.
```



#### REGEXP_REPLACE

##### Syntax

```
REGEXP_REPLACE (expr, pattern_expr [, replace_string [, start [,occurrence]]])
```



##### Description

This finds a string in *expr* that matches *pattern_expr* and replaces or removes it with another character.

For *pattern_expr*, use this function to enter the regular expression pattern (up to 1024 bytes) the user wants to find. If *pattern_expr* is an empty string or NULL , *expr* is returned as is.

Entering *replace_string* returns the result of replacing *replace_string* with the matched string in *expr*. If *replace_string* is omitted or NULL, the string that matches the regular expression pattern in *expr* is returned.

*start* is the starting position of the search, and it enters a nonzero postiive integer. If this value is omitted, the default value is 1, and the search starts from the first character of the *expr* string entered,

*occurrence* allows to set the number of *expr* occurrences of *pattern_expr*. The default value is 0, meaning that all occurrences of *pattern_expr* will be replaced.

*pattern_expr* can be a value that expresses the search pattern as a regular expression. For more information about regular expression, please refer to "Appendix A. Regular Expressions".

##### Example

\<Query\> Replace the second of the strings that match 'Guro' with 'Mapo'.

```
iSQL> SELECT
REGEXP_REPLACE('Daerungpost-Tower II Guro-3 Dong, Guro-gu Seoul',
'Guro', 'Mapo', 1, 2) "REGEXP_REPLACE"
FROM DUAL;
REGEXP_REPLACE 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Daerungpost-Tower II Guro-3 Dong, Mapo-gu Seoul 
1 row selected. 
```



#### REGEXP_SUBSTR

##### Syntax

```
REGEXP_SUBSTR (expr, pattern_expr [, start [, occurrence]])
```



##### Description

REGEXP_SUBSTR returns the matching string for *pattern_expr* from *expr.* 

*pattern_expr* is the regular expression patten to be searched for, and can contain up to 1024 bytes. 

*start* is the position at which the search is to begin, and takes the value of a positive integer other than 0. If this value is omitted, the default value is 1, and the search begins at the first character of the input *expr* string.

*occurrence* is the nth occurrence of *pattern_expr* in expr that is to be returned. The default value is 1 and this indicates the first occurrence of *pattern_expr*. 

*pattern_expr* can be a value that expresses the search patten as a regular expression. For further information on regular expressions, please refer to ”Appendix A. Regular Expressions”.

##### Example

\<Query\> Search the input string for a substring that matches the second occurrence of 'Guro', and output it.

```
iSQL> SELECT 
REGEXP_SUBSTR('Daerungpost-Tower II Guro-3 Dong, Guro-gu Seoul',
'Guro', 1, 2) "REGEXP_SUBSTR"
FROM DUAL;
REGEXP_SUBSTR
---------------
Guro
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\> Search the input string for a substring with the third occurrence of non-blank characters, and output it.

```
iSQL> SELECT
  REGEXP_SUBSTR('Daerungpost-Tower II Guro-3 Dong, Guro-gu Seoul',
  '[^ ]+', 1, 3) "REGEXP_SUBSTR" FROM DUAL;
REGEXP_SUBSTR
---------------------------------------------------
Guro-3
1 row selected.
```



#### REPLACE2

##### Syntax

```
REPLACE2 (expr1 , expr2, [expr3])
```



##### Description

REPLACE2 replaces every occurrence of *expr2* in *expr1* with *expr3* and returns the result. If *expr3* is omitted or NULL, then all occurrences of *expr2* are removed. If *expr2* is NULL, then expr1 is returned unchanged. 

Unlike the TRANSLATE function, which replaces individual characters, the REPLACE2 function replaces an entire character string with another character string.

##### Example

\<Query\> Query the departments table and replace all instances of the word “team” in the dname column with the word “division”.

```
iSQL> SELECT REPLACE2(dname, 'team', 'division')
FROM departments;
REPLACE2(DNAME, 'team', 'division') 
------------------------------------------------
Engine Development Division
Marketing Division
Planning and Management Division
Sales Division
5 rows selected.
```

\<Query\> In the character string “abcdefghicde”, replace all instances of “cde” with “xx”.

```
iSQL> SELECT REPLACE2('abcdefghicde', 'cde', 'xx') FROM dual;
REPLACE2('abcdefghicde', 'cde', 'xx')  
-----------------------------------------
abxxfghixx                
1 row selected.
```



#### REPLICATE

##### Syntax

```
REPLICATE (expr, n)
```



##### Description

REPLICATE returns a character string in which expr is repeated n times. expr must be a string and n must be a positive number. If 0 (zero) or a negative number is entered, the REPLICATE function will return NULL.

##### Example

\<Query\> Output a string comprising three repetitions of “KSKIM”.

```
iSQL> SELECT REPLICATE ('KSKIM', 3) FROM dual;
REPLICATE ('KSKIM', 3)
-----------------------------------
KSKIMKSKIMKSKIM
1 row selected.
```



#### RPAD

##### Syntax

```
RPAD (expr1, n [,expr2])
```



##### Description

RPAD pads the right end of *expr1* with the sequence of characters in *expr2*, repeatedly if necessary, until the resultant string is n characters long. If *expr2* is not specified, then *expr1* is padded with blank spaces. If *expr1* is longer than n, this function simply returns the leftmost n characters of *expr1*. 

Note that n is the number of characters, not bytes, and thus the number of bytes in the string may vary depending on the respective character sets that are in use on the server and the client (NLS_USE).

##### Example

\<Query\>  In the following example, the right side of the character string “123” is padded with “0” (zeroes) and then type-converted to return a 10-digit number.

```
iSQL> SELECT TO_NUMBER(RPAD('123', 10, '0')) rpad_ex FROM dual;
RPAD_EX     
--------------
1230000000  
1 row selected.
```

#### RTRIM

##### Syntax

```
RTRIM (expr1 [, expr2])
```



##### Description

RTRIM compares each of the characters in *expr1* with each of the characters in *expr2*, starting from the rightmost character in *expr1* and working toward the left. If any of the characters in *expr2* is the same as the current character in expr1, that character is deleted from *expr1*. This process occurs repeatedly until none of the characters in *expr2* match the current character in *expr1*, at which point the current character in *expr1* (i.e the rightmost character without a match in *expr2*) is output along with all preceding characters. 

The default value for *expr2* is a single blank. Therefore, if *expr2* is omitted, blank spaces are trimmed from the right of *expr1*.

##### Example

\<Query\> Remove all lowercase “a” and “b” characters from the end of the character string “RightTrimbaAbab” and output the result.

```
iSQL> SELECT RTRIM ('RIGHTTRIMbaAbab', 'ab') rtrim_ex FROM dual;
RTRIM_EX         
-------------------
RIGHTTRIMbaA     
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\> Retrieve the day and month that each employee joined the company by removing the trailing year information and the hyphen between the month and year.

#### SIZEOF

##### Syntax

```
SIZEOF (expr)
```



##### Description

SIZEOF returns the size of a character string or the size allocated thereto. The input character string can be CHAR, VARCHAR or any numeric data type. If the input value is of a numeric data type, it is converted to VARCHAR and the size allocated thereto is returned. 

Unlike OCTET_LENGTH, which returns the actual size of the input character string, SIZEOF returns the length of the space allocated to the input character string, or the length of the column, which was specified when the table was created. 

Note therefore that SIZEOF returns 20 for the INTEGER, BIGINT, and SMALLINT data types, 47 for the DECIMAL, FLOAT, NUMBER, and NUMERIC types, and 22 for the DOUBLE and REAL data types.

##### Example

\<Query\> Retrieve the length of the column dummy in the table *dual*.

```
iSQL> SELECT SIZEOF(dummy) FROM dual;
SIZEOF(DUMMY)   
--------------
1           
1 row selected. 
```



#### SUBSTR, SUBSTRB, SUBSTRING

##### Syntax

```
SUBSTR (expr, start [, length])
```



##### Description

SUBSTR returns a portion of *expr* that is *length* characters long, beginning at character *start*. 

If start is positive, which is typical, Altibase counts from the beginning of the input string to find the first character. start can also be set to a negative value, in which case Altibase counts backwards from the end of string to find the first character. If start is set to 0, then it is handled as though it were set to 1. 

If *length* is omitted, then Altibase returns all characters to the end of the string.

The input character string can be CHAR, VARCHAR, or any numeric data type. If the input value is of a numeric data type, it is converted to VARCHAR. The type of the return value is VARCHAR.

Unlike SUBSTR, which determines the position and length in units of the characters of the input character set, SUBSTRB determines the position and length in units of bytes rather than characters. 

SUBSTRING has the same function as SUBSTR.

##### Example

\<Query\> Return a substring of the character string “SALESMAN”, 5 characters long and starting from the first character.

```
iSQL> SELECT SUBSTR('SALESMAN', 1 ,5) Substring FROM dual;
SUBSTRING  
-------------
SALES     
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\>  Return a substring of the input string “ABCDEFG”.

```
iSQL> SELECT SUBSTR('ABCDEFG', -5 ,4) Substring FROM dual;
SUBSTRING  
-------------
CDEF     
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\> Return a character string 2 bytes in length, starting from the 5th byte in the character string “ABCDEFG”

```
iSQL> SELECT SUBSTRB('ABCDEFG', 5, 2) Substring_with_bytes FROM dual;
SUBSTRING_WITH_BYTES  
------------------------
EF       
1 row selected.
```



#### TRANSLATE

##### Syntax

```
TRANSLATE (expr1 , expr2, expr3)
```



##### Description

TRANSLATE checks each character in *expr1* to determine whether it is found in *expr*. If the character is not found in *expr*, it is left as it is. If, however, the character is found in *expr2*, it is left as it is. If, however, the character is found in *expr2*, it is replaced by the character at the corresponding p

It is possible to specify *expr2* so that it has more characters than *expr3*. In this case, some characters at the end of *expr2* will have no corresponding characters in *expr3*. If any of these characters are found in *expr1*, they are simply removed from the character string to be returned. Setting expr3 to an empty string causes this function to remove all characters in *expr2* from *expr1*.

If *expr3* is longer than *expr2*, the remaining characters in *expr3* are ignored. If the same character is specified multiple times in *expr2*, the first match in *expr3* is used.

##### Example

\<Query\> For all items for which the quantity in inventory is more than 50000, replace the letter “M” in the product name with “L”.

```
iSQL> SELECT TRANSLATE(gname, 'M', 'L')
FROM goods
WHERE stock > 50000;
TRANSLATE(GNAME, 'M', 'L')                
--------------------------------------------

2 rows selected.
```

\<Query\> Convert all alphabetic characters in a string to lowercase.

```
iSQL> SELECT 
TRANSLATE('0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789',        
'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ',                  
'abcdefghijlkmnopqrstuvwxyz')  
FROM dual;
TRANSLATE('0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRS 
------------------------------------------------
0123456789abcdefghijlkmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789 
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\>  Remove all alphabetic characters from a license number and return only the numbers. 

```
iSQL> SELECT TRANSLATE('3PQR334',
'0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ',
'0123456789') License
FROM dual;
LICENSE         
------------------
3334            
1 row selected.
```



#### TRIM

##### Syntax

```
TRIM (expr1 [, expr2])
```



##### Description

TRIM returns a substring of expr1 that starts with the first character that is not found in expr2 and ends with the last character that is not found in expr2. The portion of expr1 between these two characters is returned without change. 

In other words, TRIM removes all characters found in expr2 from the beginning and end of expr1, and returns the result. 

TRIM is, therefore, functionally the same as executing both LTRIM and RTRIM with the same value of expr2. 

The default value for expr2 is a single space. This means that if expr2 is not specified, all blank spaces are trimmed from both ends of expr1.

##### Example

\<Query\> Remove all instances of lowercase “a” and “b” from both ends of the character string “abbAaBbAbba” and output the result.

```
iSQL> SELECT TRIM ('abbAaBbAbba', 'ab') trim_ex FROM dual;
TRIM_EX      
---------------
AaBbA        
1 row selected.
```



#### UPPER

##### Syntax

```
UPPER (char)
```



##### Description

UPPER returns the input string with all letters converted to uppercase.

##### Example

\<Query\> Convert the input string into uppercase letters and output it.

```
iSQL> SELECT UPPER('Capital') Uppercase FROM dual;
UPPERCASE  
-------------
CAPITAL  
1 row selected.

#### REVERSE_STR

##### Syntax

```
REVERSE_STR (expr)
```



##### Description

REVERSE_STR reverses the order of the characters in expr and returns the result. 

##### Examples

\<Query\> Output the string ”KSKIM” in reverse.

```
iSQL> SELECT REVERSE_STR ('KSKIM') FROM dual;
REVERSE_STR ('KSKIM')  
-------------------------
MIKSK  
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\>  Reverse the characters in the string '알티베이스5' and output the result. (Note that the database character set has been set to KO16KSC5601)

1 row selected.
```



#### STUFF

##### Syntax

```
STUFF (expr1, start, length, expr2)
```



##### Description

STUFF removes a substring, beginning at the position specified by start and having the length specified by length, from expr1, and inserts expr2 in its place. 

If length is specified as 0 (zero), expr2 is simply inserted without first deleting anything from expr1. In this case, expr2 is inserted to the left of the position specified using start. If length is greater than the number of characters to the right of the start position in expr1, all characters in expr1 to the right of start are removed, and expr2 is inserted. 

To simply concatenate expr2 to the end of expr1, set start to (1 + the length of expr1) and length to 0 (zero) or a positive number. 

If the value of either start or length is negative, or if the value of start is greater than (1 + the length of expr1), an error will occur.

##### Example

\<Query\> Use the STUFF function to convert ”KDHONG” to “KILDONG HONG”.

```
iSQL> SELECT STUFF (‘KDHONG’, 2, 1, ‘ILDONG ’) FROM dual;
STUFF (‘KDHONG’, 2, 1, ‘ILDONG ’)
--------------------------------------------------
KILDONG HONG
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\>  Insert *expr2* before *expr1*.

```
iSQL> SELECT STUFF (‘KDHONG’, 1, 0, ‘ILDONG ’) FROM dual;
STUFF (‘KDHONG’, 1, 0, ‘ILDONG ’)
--------------------------------------------------
ILDONG KDHONG
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\> Insert *expr2* after *expr1*.

```
iSQL> SELECT STUFF (‘KDHONG’, 7, 0, ‘ILDONG ’) FROM dual;
STUFF (‘KDHONG’, 7, 0, ‘ILDONG ’)
--------------------------------------------------
KDHONGILDONG 
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\> Set length to 0 to insert *expr2* to the left of the start position without deleting anything.

```
iSQL> SELECT STUFF (‘KDHONG’, 2, 0, ‘ILDONG ’) FROM dual;
STUFF (‘KDHONG’, 2, 0, ‘ILDONG ’)
--------------------------------------------------
KILDONG DHONG
1 row selected.
```

```
iSQL> SELECT STUFF ('알티베이스0', 5, 1, '데이터베이스') FROM dual;
STUFF ('알티베이스0', 5, 1, '데이터베이스’)
------------------------------------------------
알티베이데이터베이스0
1 row selected.
```



### Datatime Funcitons

These functions perform tasks on entered date and time values and return character, numeric or date/time type values. If a value of an input argument is of the character data type, the value must be entered in the format set in the ALTIBASE_DATE_FORMAT environment variable or the DEFAULT_DATE_FORMAT property (the former takes precedence). Additionally, this format is also used to display date/time values that are returned when these functions are executed at the iSQL prompt. 

For more information on the DATE data type and the datetime format model, which is used when returning date type data, please refer to the *General Reference.*

#### ADD_MONTHS

#### DATEADD

##### Syntax

```
DATEADD (date, number, date_field_name)
```



##### Description

DATEADD increases the element of date that is specified using date_field_name by the amount specified using n. If n is a non-integer, the places after the decimal point are first discarded (i.e. the value is truncated), and then the operation is carried out. 

If the value of date_field_name is 'SECOND', n (that is, the number of seconds) cannot exceed the equivalent of 68 years. If it is 'MICROSECOND', n cannot exceed the equivalent of 30 days. 

The following table shows the date_field_name values that can be used with the DATEADD function, and the result in each case:

| Date Field Name | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| CENTURY         | The year portion of date is increased by n*100.   |
| YEAR            | The year portion of date is increased by n.       |
| QUARTER         | The month portion of date is increased by n*3.    |
| MONTH           | The month portion of date is increased by n.      |
| WEEK            | The day portion of date is increased by n*7       |
| DAY             | The day portion of date is increased by n..       |
| HOUR            | The hour portion of date is increased by n.       |
| MINUTE          | The minute portion of date is increased by n.     |
| SECOND          | The second portion of date is increased by n.     |
| MICROSECOND     | The microsecond portion of date is increased by n |

##### Example

#### DATEDIFF

##### Syntax

```
DATEDIFF (startdate, enddate, date_field_name)
```



##### Example

DATEDIFF returns the difference between enddate and startdate (i.e. enddate - startdate) in the units specified using date_field_name. If startdate is greater than enddate, a negative number is returned. 

This function first determines the values of enddate and startdate in the units specified using date_field_name, and then returns the difference. This function always returns an integer. Noninteger results are truncated, that is, rounded down. 

The possible values for date_field_name with DATEDIFF, that is, the units in which the resultant value can be returned, are as follows:

-   CENTURY

-   YEAR

-   QUARTER

-   MONTH

-   WEEK

-   DAY

-   HOUR

-   MINUTE

-   SECOND

-   MICROSECOND

The range of values that the DATEDIFF function can return is limited for particular values of date_field_name. If the value of date_field_name is 'SECOND', the difference between enddate and startdate cannot exceed 68 years. If it is 'MICROSECOND', the difference between enddate and startdate cannot exceed 30 days. 

The result returned by this function is in the BIG INTEGER data type.

##### Example

\<Query\> Get the difference between August 31, 2005 and November 30, 2005 in months.

```
iSQL> SELECT DATEDIFF ('31-AUG-2005', '30-NOV-2005', 'MONTH') FROM dual;

### Encryption Functions

Altibase provides functions for encrypting strings and decrypting encrypted strings. The encryption algorithms that are available in Altibase are Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). 

The encryption functions of Altibase perform block encryption in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. The DES algorithm is used to encrypt blocks in 8 bytes, and the more advanced AES algorithm is used to encrypt blocks in 16 bytes. If a string to encrypt is not a multiple of 8 or 16 bytes in length, it can be padded with characters to fill the required length by using the PKCS7PAD16 function.

The encryption functions using these algorithms are listed below. 

-   AES: AESDECRYPT, AESENCRYPT

-   DES: DESDECRYPT, DESENCRYPT, TDESDECRYPT, TDESENCRYPT

#### CASE WHEN 

##### Syntax

**case**

![case](media/SQL/case.gif)

**simple_case_expr**

![simple_case_expr](media/SQL/simple_case_expr.gif)

**searched_case_expr**

![searched_case_expr](media/SQL/searched_case_expr.gif)

**else_clause**

![else_clause](media/SQL/else_clause.gif)

##### Description

When CASE WHEN is used with *searched_case_expr*, it is the same as CASE2. That is, it *returns return_expr* for the first condition that evaluates to TRUE. If all of the specified condition evaluate to FALSE, CASE WHEN *returns else_expr* if specified, or NULL otherwise. When using this function in this way, a variety of comparison operators can be used. 

When CASE WHEN is used with *simple_case_expr*, *expr* is compared with each of *comparison_expr* using the equality operator ("=").

##### Example

\<Query\> Output ‘aaaaa’ if the value of the third character in column c1 is a, output ‘bbbbb’ if it is b, output ‘ccccc’ if it is c, and output ‘zzzzz’ otherwise. 

```
create table test (c1 char(10));
insert into test values('abcdefghi');
iSQL> select CASE substring(c1,3,1)
       WHEN 'a' THEN 'aaaaa'
       WHEN 'b' THEN 'bbbbb'    
       WHEN 'c' THEN 'ccccc'    
       END

#### COALESCE

##### Syntax

```
COALESCE (expr1, expr2, …, exprn)
```



##### Description

COALESCE returns the first non-NULL expression among the given input expressions. 

If expr1 is not NULL, expr1 is returned; if expr1 is NULL, the first non-NULL expression among the following expressions is returned. If all of the input expressions are NULL, this function returns NULL. 

More than two expressions must be specified for this function.

##### Example

\<Query\> Obtain the first non-NULL expression from the input expressions.

```
iSQL> select coalesce( NULL, 'a') from dual;
COALESCE( NULL, 'a')
------------------------
a
1 row selected.

iSQL> select coalesce( NULL, NULL, NULL) from dual;

#### DECODE

##### Syntax

```
DECODE (expr, comparison_expr1, ret_expr1,
     [, comparison_expr2, ret_expr2,..,]
     [, default])
```

##### Description

The functionality of DECODE is similar to that of CASE WHEN when used with simple_case_expr. That is, expr is sequentially compared with each of comparison_expr using the equality operator (“=”), and the return_expr corresponding to the first comparison_expr that matches expr is returned. If none of comparison_expr match expr, default is returned. If none of comparison_expr match expr and default is not specified, NULL is returned.

##### Examples

\<Query\>  If i is NULL, 1 or 2, return the string “NULL”, “ONE” or “TWO”, respectively.

```
CREATE TABLE t2(i NUMBER);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(NULL);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(1);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(2);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(3);

##### Description

SENDMSG sends a user message to the specified IP address and port as a socket datagram. If a regular IP address is entered, a UDP datagram is sent. If a multicast IP address is entered, a multicast datagram is sent. 

Multicast IP addresses are limited to the range from 225.0.0.0 - 238.0.0.255; that is, reserved multicast groups cannot be used.

The usable port range is from 1025 to 65535. 

msg cannot exceed 2048 bytes. 

*ttl* stands for time-to-live. This argument is useful when sending a message to a multicast IP address. It limits the transfer range during multicast transfer as shown below. The range of possible ttl values is from 0 to 255.

| TTL    | Range                                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0      | Limited to the inside of the host, cannot be output past the network interface |
| 1      | Limited to the same subnet, not forwarded beyond router      |
| \< 32  | Limited to the same site, organization or department         |
| \< 64  | Limited to the same region                                   |
| \< 128 | Limited to the same continent                                |
| \< 255 | Unlimited, worldwide                                         |

The return value is an INTEGER indicating the length of the message that was sent.

##### Example

\<Query\> Send a user message to a regular IP address (in this case, the value of *ttl* is ignored).

```
iSQL> SELECT SENDMSG( '192.168.1.60', 12345, 'THIS IS A MESSAGE', 1 ) FROM T1;
SENDMSG( '192.168.1.60', 12345, 'THIS IS

## 8. Arithmetic Operators

-----------

This chapter describes the arithmetic operators that can be used in SQL statements in Altibase.

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to sign, add, subtract, multiply, and divide numeric values. Some of these operators can also be used to perform arithmetic on date values. Arithmetic operations can only be performed on numeric data types or on data types that can be implicitly converted to numeric data types.

#### The Type of Arthmetic Operators

The following is a brief description of the kinds of arithmetic operators that are supported in Altibase

| Operator                       | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "+" Unary operator             | Explicitly specifies a positive number                       |
| "-" Unary operator             | Reserves the sign of the input number                        |
| Four basic arthmetic operators | Perform respective operations on two input numbers (arguments) to yield a result |
| Concatenation operator         | Joins two character strings                                  |

### Unary Operator

#### Positive Sign

##### Syntax

```
+ number
```



##### Description

This operator is used to xplicitly indicate that n is a positive number.

#### Negative Sign

##### Syntax

```
- number
```



##### Description

This operator is used to change the sign of n.

### Binary Opeartors

#### Addition	

##### Syntax

```
number1 + number2
```



##### Description

This operator adds n1 and n2 and outputs the result.

#### Subtraction

##### Syntax

```
number1 - number2
```



##### Description

This operator subtracts n2 from n1 and outputs the result.

#### Multiplication

##### Syntax

```
number1 x number2
```



##### Description

This operator multiplies n1 by n2 and outputs the result.

#### Division

##### Syntax

```
number1 / number2
```



##### Description

This operator divides n1 by n2 and outputs the result.

#### Performing Arithmetic on DATE Type Values

When a number is added to or subtracted from a DATE type value, it is interpreted in units of days. Therefore, to add or subtract hours, minutes, or seconds from a DATE type value, the number of hours, minutes or seconds to be added or subtracted must be converted to days, as shown below: 

```
date [ + | - ] n
date – date
date [ + | - ] days (더하기/빼기 n일: n)
date [ + | - ] hours (더하기/빼기 n시간: n/24) )
date [ + | - ] minutes (더하기/빼기 n분: n/(24*60) )
date [ + | - ] seconds (더하기/빼기 n초: n/(24*60*60))
```

> Note:
>
> It is not possible, or meaningful, to perform multiplication or division on DATE type values.

##### Example

\<Query\> Display the name and the number of weeks worked for every employee in the department 4001:

```
iSQL> SELECT e_firstname, e_lastname, (SYSDATE-join_date)/7 Weeks_worked 
 FROM employees 
 WHERE dno = 4001;
E_FIRSTNAME           E_LASTNAME            WEEKS_WORKED
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Xiong                 Wang                  115.778199044248

John                  Huxley                224.492484758533
3 rows selected
```

\<Query\> Display the time 10 minutes in the future, that is, 10 minutes from the current time:

```
iSQL> SELECT SYSDATE + (10/(24*60)) '10 MINUTES LATER' FROM dual;
10 MINUTES LATER 
-----------------------
2005/01/20 09:59:34 
1 row selected.
```



### Concatenation Operator

##### Syntax

```
char1 || char2
```



##### Description

The concatenation operator is used to join two strings together.

##### Example

\<Query\> Put the text ' is a ' between the employee name and the position to create a sentence, and display the sentence in a single column.

```

## 9. SQL Conditions

-----------

This chapter describes the conditional operators that can be used in conditional clauses in SQL statements in Altibase.

### SQL Conditions Overview

A SQL condition consists of one or several logical operators and expressions. The return value of a condition is one of the three possible logical outcomes: TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN.

Conditions can be used in any of these clauses of a SELECT statement:

-   WHERE

-   START WITH

-   CONNECT BY

-   HAVING

Additionally, conditions can be used in the WHERE clause of DELETE and UPDATE statements. 

The sections that follow describe the various kinds of conditions in detail.

#### Logical Conditions

The following logical conditions are supported for use with Altibase. Each of them is described briefly below.

| Local operators | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AND             | Returns TRUE if both of the constituent conditions are TRUE. Returns FALSE if either or both of the constituent conditions are FALSE. |
| NOT             | Returns the opposite of the condition to which it applies. That is, it returns TRUE if the condition is FALSE, and returns FALSE if the condition is TRUE. |
| OR              | Returns TRUE if either or both of the constituent conditions are TRUE. Returns FALSE if both of the constituent conditions are FALSE. |

#### Comparison Conditions

Comparison conditions can be categorized as either simple comparisons or group comparisons. 

Simple comparison conditions are those in which one expression is compared with one expression.

Group comparison conditions are those in which one expression is compared with many expressions, or with multiple rows returned by a subquery.

#### Other Conditions

The other conditions that are supported for use with Altibase are listed and described briefly below.

| Condition Type        | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| BETWEEN condition     | This is a kind of comparison condition that is used to determine whether a value is within a given range. |
| EXISTS condition      | The EXISTS condition is used to check whether a subquery returns at least one row. |
| IN condition          | The IN condition is used to determine whether a value is the same as one or more in a list of values or results returned by a subquery. A NOT IN condition is used to determine whether a value is unlike all members in a list of values or results returned by a subquery. |
| INLIST condition      | The IN condition is used to determin whether a value is in a given list. |
| IS NULL condition     | The IS NULL condition is used to determine whether a value is a NULL value. |
| LIKE condition        | LIKE is a patter-matching condition that is used to determine whether a string contains a given sequence of characters ("patters"). |
| REGEXP_LIKE condition | REGEXP_LIKE is a regular expression matching condition that is used to determine whether a string contains a given regular expression. |
| UNIQUE condition      | A UNIQUE condition is used to check whether a subquery returns exactly one row. |

### Logical Condition	

#### AND

##### Syntax

```
condition1 AND condition2
```



##### Description 

AND performs a logical AND evaluation on condition1 and condition2 and returns TRUE if both conditions are TRUE. It returns FALSE if either of them is FALSE. AND cannot return TRUE if either condition is UNKNOWN.

This is the AND Truth Table: 

| *Condition1 (Right)<br />\ <br />Condition2(Bottom)* | TRUE    | FALSE | UNKNOWN |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
| TRUE                                                 | TRUE    | FALSE | UNKNOWN |
| FALSE                                                | FALSE   | FALSE | FALSE   |
| UNKNOWN                                              | UNKNOWN | FALSE | UNKNOWN |

##### Example

\<Query\> Display the names, wages, and hiring dates of all employees who are engineers and earn 2,000 dollars or more.

```
iSQL> SELECT e_firstname, e_lastname, salary, join_date 
 FROM employees 
 WHERE emp_job = 'engineer' 
 AND salary >= 2000;
E_FIRSTNAME           E_LASTNAME            SALARY      JOIN_DATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken                   Kobain                2000        11-JAN-2010
1 row selected.
```



#### NOT

##### Syntax

```
NOT condition
```



##### Description

NOT returns the opposite of the input *condition*.

| *Condition* | TRUE  | FALSE | UNKNOWN |
| ----------- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| NOT Result  | FALSE | TRUE  | UNKNOWN |

##### Example

\<Query\>  Display the names, departments, and birthdays of all employees except those born before 1980.

```
iSQL> SELECT e_lastname, e_firstname, dno, birth 
 FROM employees 
 WHERE NOT birth < BYTE'800101';
E_LASTNAME            E_FIRSTNAME           DNO         BIRTH
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Foster                Aaron                 3001        820730
Fleischer             Gottlieb              4002        840417
Wang                  Xiong                 4001        810726
Hammond               Sandra                4002        810211
Jones                 Mitch                 1002        801102
Davenport             Jason                 1003        901212
6 rows selected.
```



#### OR

##### Syntax

```
condition1 OR condition2
```



##### Description

OR performs a logical OR evaluation on condition1 and condition2 and returns TRUE if either or both conditions are TRUE.

This is the OR Truth Table:

| *Condition1 (Right)<br />\ <br />Condition2(Bottom)* | TRUE | FALSE   | UNKNOWN |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------- | ------- |
| TRUE                                                 | TRUE | TRUE    | TRUE    |
| FALSE                                                | TRUE | FALSE   | UNKNOWN |
| UNKNOWN                                              | TRUE | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN |

##### Example

\<Query\>  Display the data for all inventory items numbering more than 20000 in stock or having a unit price of 100000 KRW or higher.

```
iSQL\> SELECT \*

FROM goods

WHERE stock \> 20000 OR price \>= 100000;

GOODS.GNO GOODS.GNAME GOODS.GOODS_LOCATION GOODS.STOCK

### Comparision Conditions	

Comparison conditions can be broadly classified into simple comparison conditions and group comparison conditions on the basis of whether a single expression is compared with one expression or with many expressions.

#### Simple Comparison Condition

##### Syntax

**simple_comparison_condition ::=**

![simple_comparison_condition_image260](media/SQL/simple_comparison_condition_image260.gif)

##### Description

Simple comparison conditions compare the expressions on the left and right on the basis of the specified operator and return TRUE, FALSE or UNKNOWN. 

Simple comparison conditions can be classified into those that compare the size of the two expressions and those that simply determine whether the two expressions are equivalent. 

When there are two or more expressions on each side of the operator (the lower path in the above diagram), only equality comparisons can be conducted. That is, size comparisons are not possible. 

Additionally, the number of expressions on the left must be the same as the number of expressions on the right. This rule also applies when the expressions take the form of a subquery SELECT list. 

Furthermore, when a subquery is used in a simple comparison, it must return only a single record.

##### Example

\<Query\> Display the name, quantity, unit price, and value of inventory for all products for which the value of inventory is more than 100 million KRW. (The value of inventory is the quantity multiplied by the unit price.)

```
iSQL> SELECT gname, stock, price, stock*price value_of_inv
FROM goods
WHERE stock*price > 100000000;
GNAME      STOCK    PRICE      VALUE_OF_INV 
------------------------------------------------
IT-U950    35000    7820.55    273719250 
TM-T88     10000    72000      720000000 
TM-U950    8000     96200      769600000
.
.
.
11 rows selected.
```



#### Group Comparison Conditions

##### Syntax

**group_comparison_condition ::=**

![group_comparison_condition_image267](media/SQL/group_comparison_condition_image267.gif)

##### Description

In a group comparison condition, the expression on the left is compared with each of the expressions or subquery results on the right. It is acceptable, and typical, for the subquery to return multiple rows. 

When there are two or more expressions on the left side of the operator, only equality comparisons can be conducted, but size comparisons cannot. Additionally, the expressions on the right must be nested using parentheses to form groups. The number of elements in each group, or alternatively the number of columns returned by a subquery, must be the same as the number of expressions on the left.

-   ANY / SOME  
    The ANY and SOME keywords have the same meaning. Group comparison conditions containing either keyword return TRUE if the comparison of the expression on the left with at least one of the expressions or subquery results on the right returns TRUE.
    
-   ALL  
    Group comparison conditions containing the ALL keyword return TRUE only when the expression on the left is compared with all of the expressions or subquery results on the right and TRUE is returned in every case.

##### Example

\<Query\>  Display information about all orders taken by any employee whose last name starts with “B”.

```
iSQL> SELECT ono, order_date, processing 
 FROM orders 
 WHERE eno = ANY 
(SELECT eno FROM employees WHERE e_lastname LIKE 'B%');
ONO                  ORDER_DATE   PROCESSING
--------------------------------------------------
12300003             29-DEC-2011  P
12300004             30-DEC-2011  P
12300006             30-DEC-2011  P
12300008             30-DEC-2011  P
12300009             30-DEC-2011  P
12300011             30-DEC-2011  P
12300013             30-DEC-2011  P
12310001             31-DEC-2011  O
12310003             31-DEC-2011  O
12310005             31-DEC-2011  O
12310006             31-DEC-2011  O
12310010             31-DEC-2011  O
12 rows selected.
```



### Other Conditions

#### BETWEEN

##### Syntax 

**between_condition ::=**

![between_image261](media/SQL/between_image261.gif)

##### Description

BETWEEN comparisons are used to check whether a value falls within a given range.

*column1* between x1 and x2’ is logically the same as *column1* >= x1 and *column1* <= x2’

##### Example

\<Query\> Display the name, quantity, unit price, and value of inventory for all products for which the value of inventory is between 1 million KRW and 10 million KRW. (The value of inventory is the quantity multiplied by the unit price.)

```
iSQL> SELECT gname, stock, price, stock*price value_of_inv
FROM goods
WHERE stock*price BETWEEN 1000000 AND 10000000;
GNAME      STOCK      PRICE     VALUE_OF_INV 
------------------------------------------------
IM-310     100        98000     9800000 
.
.
.
M-T500     5000       1000.54   5002700 
7 rows selected.
```



#### EXISTS

##### Syntax

**exists_condition ::=**

![exists_image265](media/SQL/exists_image265.gif)

##### Description

An EXISTS condition is used to check whether a subquery returns any rows. If at least one row is returned, the EXISTS condition returns TRUE.

##### Example

\<Query\>  Output the customer numbers of customers who ordered at least two kinds of products. (The orders table is first queried to find pairs of rows having the same customer number but different product numbers, which indicate customers who ordered more than one kind of product. If such a pair of rows exists, the EXISTS condition returns TRUE, so the customer number is output).

```
iSQL> SELECT DISTINCT cno
FROM orders a
WHERE EXISTS
 (SELECT *
 FROM orders b
 WHERE a.cno = b.cno
 AND NOT(a.gno = b.gno));
CNO 
------------------
19
15
14
11
6
5
3
2
1
9 rows selected.
```

\<Query\> Retrieve the names of any customers who have ordered all available products. The innermost subquery, which is located at the end of the query string, finds the products ordered by each customer in the *orders* table. The next subquery, located in the middle of the query string, searches for products that have not been ordered by that customer. If there are no products that have not been ordered by that customer, the customer's name will be displayed.

```
iSQL> SELECT customers.c_lastname
FROM customers
WHERE NOT EXISTS
 (SELECT *
 FROM goods
 WHERE NOT EXISTS
 (SELECT *
 FROM orders
 WHERE orders.cno = customers.cno
 AND orders.gno = goods.gno));
CNAME 
------------------------
No rows selected.
```



#### IN

##### Syntax

**in_condition ::=**

![in_image262](media/SQL/in_image262.gif)

##### Description

The IN condition is the same as a group comparison using the '=ANY' condition. This kind of condition returns TRUE if the expression on the left matches any of the expressions on the right. 

The NOT IN condition is the same as a group comparison using the '!=ALL' condition. This kind of condition returns TRUE if none of the expressions on the right match the expression on the left.

##### Example

\<Query\> Display the name, position, and telephone number of every employee who is on either the application development team or the marketing team.

```
iSQL> SELECT e_firstname, e_lastname, emp_job, emp_tel 
 FROM employees 
 WHERE dno IN (1003, 4001);
E_FIRSTNAME           E_LASTNAME            EMP_JOB          EMP_TEL
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

.
.
.
7 rows selected.
```

The WHERE clause in the above SQL statement has the same meaning as:

```
WHERE DNO = 1003 or DNO = 4001
```

\<Query\> Retrieve the names of customers who ordered product number C111100001.

```
iSQL> SELECT DISTINCT customers.c_lastname, customers.c_firstname 
 FROM customers 
 WHERE customers.cno 
 IN (SELECT orders.cno FROM orders WHERE orders.gno = 'C111100001');
C_LASTNAME            C_FIRSTNAME
-----------------------------------------------

Fedorov               Fyodor
Dureault              Phil
Sanchez               Estevan
4 rows selected.
```



#### INLIST

##### Syntax

**inlist_condition ::=**

![inlist_operator](media/SQL/inlist_operator.gif)

##### Description

The INLIST condition returns TRUE if any of the individual values in *comma_separated_values* match expr.

The NOT INLIST condition returns TRUE if none of the individual values in comma_separated_values match expr. Each value in *comma_separated_values* must be a string containing only ASCII characters. 

The values in *comma_separated_values* are automatically converted to the type of expr in order to perform the comparison.



##### Example

```
iSQL> SELECT dno, e_firstname, e_lastname 
 FROM employees 
 WHERE INLIST (dno, '1003,4001' );
DNO         E_FIRSTNAME           E_LASTNAME

4001        John                  Huxley
7 rows selected.
```



#### IS NULL

##### Syntax

**isnull_condition ::=**

![isnull_image264](media/SQL/isnull_image264.gif)

##### Description

The IS NULL condition is used to check whether or not the expression is NULL.

##### Example

\<Query\>  Display the employee number, name, and position of every employee whose birthday has not been input.

```
iSQL> SELECT eno, e_firstname, e_lastname, emp_job 
 FROM employees 
 WHERE salary IS NULL;
ENO         E_FIRSTNAME           E_LASTNAME            EMP_JOB
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1           Chan-seung            Moon                  CEO
8           Xiong                 Wang                  manager
20          William               Blake                 sales rep
3 rows selected.
```



#### LIKE

##### Syntax

**like_condition ::=**

![like_image263](media/SQL/like_image263.gif)

##### Description

LIKE is a pattern-matching condition that is used to determine whether a string contains a given sequence of characters (“pattern”). The percent (“%”) and underscore (“_”) characters are wildcard characters in LIKE conditions. “%” is used to represent a string, while “_” is used to represent a single character. 

When it is desired to search for the actual characters “%” or “_”, rather than using them as wildcards, use the ESCAPE keyword at the end of the LIKE condition to define an escape character, and then use the escape character in front of “%” or “_” to indicate that it is not to be handled as a wildcard character

The maximum length for a pattern string is 4000 bytes.

##### Examples

\<Query\> Display the employee number, name, department number, and telephone number of every employee whose last name starts with “D”.

```
iSQL> SELECT eno, e_lastname, e_firstname, dno, emp_tel FROM employees WHERE e_lastname LIKE 'D%';
ENO         E_LASTNAME            E_FIRSTNAME           DNO         EMP_TEL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2           Davenport             Susan                             0113654540
9           Diaz                  Curtis                4001        0165293668

3 rows selected.
```

In the above example, the backslash (“\”) is defined as an escape character using the ESCAPE option. Using this escape character before the underscore character indicates that the underscore character is not to be handled as a wildcard.

\<Query\> Display the first names of all employees who have the letter “h” in their first names.

```
iSQL> SELECT e_firstname 
 FROM employees 
 WHERE e_firstname LIKE '%h%';
E_FIRSTNAME
------------------------

#### REGEXP_LIKE

##### Syntax

**regexp_like_condition ::=**

![regexp_like_condition](media/SQL/regexp_like_condition.gif)

##### Description

REGEXP_LIKE is similar to the LIKE condition. While LIKE performs simple pattern matching, REGEXP_LIKE performs regular expression matching. Altibase supports POSIX Basic Regular Expression (BRE). For more detailed information on regular expressions, please refer to Appendix A. Regular Expressions.

*source_expr* can be a column or character expression that is a search target. *source_expr* generally takes the form of a CHARACTER type column, such as CHAR and VARCHAR CHAR columns. 

*pattern_expr* can be a value which expresses a search pattern as a regular expression. *pattern_expr* generally takes the form of a string, and can contain up to 1024 bytes.

##### Example

\<Query\>  Output the employee number, name, department number and telephone number of employees whose last name starts with “D”.

```
iSQL> SELECT eno, e_lastname, e_firstname, dno, emp_tel FROM employees WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(e_lastname, '^D');
ENO         E_LASTNAME            E_FIRSTNAME           DNO         EMP_TEL

#### UNIQUE

##### Syntax

**unique_condition ::=**

![unique_image266](media/SQL/unique_image266.gif)

##### Description

UNIQUE is used to determine whether a subquery returns only a single row.

##### Example

\<Query\> If there is only one CEO, output the following message: “There is only one CEO”.

```
iSQL> SELECT 'There is only one CEO.' message 
 FROM dual 
 WHERE UNIQUE 
  (SELECT * 
  FROM employees 
  WHERE emp_job = 'CEO');
MESSAGE
--------------------------
There is only one CEO.
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\> If there is only one female customer in the customers table, output the following message: 'There is only one female customer.'

```
iSQL> SELECT 'There is only one female customer.' message
FROM dual
WHERE UNIQUE
 (SELECT *
 FROM customers
 WHERE SEX = 'F');
ENAME 
------------------------
No rows selected.
```

This section explains the regular expressions supported by Altibase.

### Regular Expression Support

Regular expressions are a syntax convention for writing text patterns and consist of one or more character strings and metacharacters. Altibase partly supports POSIX Basic Regular Expression (BRE) and Extended Regular Expression (ERE). Regular expressions supported by Altibase have the following limitations and features.

-   Multibyte characters are unsupported. 
-   Backreferences ( \digit) are unsupported. 
-   Lookaheads ( ?=)and lookbehinds ( ?<=) are unsupported. 
-   Conditional regular expressions (e.g., condition)B|C) are unsupported. 
-   The escape character is supported.

The following table describes character classes.

The following table describes metacharacters that can be used for regular expressions in Altibase, and their meanings.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>
<p>Metacharacter</p>
</th>
<th>
<p>Description</p>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Matches a single character, other than the newline. The punctuation character(.) of a regular expression enclosed in square brackets matches the literal
dot. For example, a.c matches “abc”, but [a.c] matches only “a”, “.”, or “c”. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>[]</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>A character class expression. Matches a single character enclosed in square
brackets. For example, [abc] matches “a”, “b”, or “c”; [a-z] matches any alphabetic character in lowercase, from “a” to “z”. The format can also be
mixed: both [a-cx-z] and [abcx-z] match “a”, “b”, “c”, “x”, “y”, or “z”.
If the right square bracket (]) is the initial character to follow a circumflex (^),
it can be included in the expression enclosed in square brackets: []abc].</p>
<p>] If the circumflex (^) is the initial character enclosed in square brackets ([]), it
matches any character other than those enclosed in the square brackets ([]). For
example, [^abc]d matches “ed”, “fd”, but not “ad”, “bd” and “cd”. [^a-z]
matches any character that does not start with an alphabetic character in lowercase.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>^</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Matches the beginning character of a string.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>$</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Matches the last character of a string or the preceding character of the last
newline of a string.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>*</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Matches the preceding element for 0 or more times. For example, ab*c matches "ac", "abc", "abbbc", etc.; [xyz]* matches "", "x", "y", "z", "zx", "zyx",
"xyzzy", etc.; (ab)* matches "", "ab", "abab", "ababab", etc.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>+</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Matches the preceding character for 1 or more times.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>?</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Matches the preceding character for 0 or 1 time.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>{m,n}</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Matches the preceding element for a minimum of m, and a maximum of n
times. For example a{3,5} matches "aaa", "aaaa", and "aaaaa".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>{m}</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Matches the preceding element for m times.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>{m,}</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Matches the preceding element for m or more times.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>|</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Matches a single expression among multiple expressions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>()</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Matches a subexpression. Multiple expressions can be grouped as a single
complex regular expression.</p>
