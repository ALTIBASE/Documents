Altibase Sharding introduces Sharding technology in Altibase to improve the storage capacity and throughput per hour to distribute large volumes of database.

Altibase Sharding supports "server side sharding" and "client side sharding" simultaneously. The user can choose client-side sharding as needed to improve the performance of application, or the user can choose server-side sharding to improve compatibility.

In particular, the client side sharding of Altibase Sharding can be applied by simply replacing the shard-only library without modifying existing application source code or existing SQL statements.

Please refer to the manual below for more information.

-   Altibase Sharding Guide

#### SQL Extension

DISJOIN TABEL: The user can use this statement to convert a partition in a partitioned table into a non-partitioned table. The hash partition is not supported whereas the existing partition attributes of the non-partitioned table remain the same.

Please refer to the manual below for more information.

-   *SQL Reference > Chapter 3. Data Definition Language> CONJOIN TABLE, DISJOIN TABLE*

##### IPCDA Protocol

IPCDA(Inter Process Communication Direct Attach) is a protocol provided by Altibase to exchange data between the server and client by using shared memory. IPCDA can produce much advanced performance by reducing idle time between the server and client as well as simplifying data reading and writing.

CLI and OBDB is supported, but JDBC is not supported. Besides, LOB data cannot be used when using IPCDA. IPCDA is only supported on Linux. The following properties should be configured to use IPCDA.

To communicate using IPCDA, the following IPCDA-related server properties must be set.
