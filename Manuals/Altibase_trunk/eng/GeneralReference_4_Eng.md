#### Column Information

##### LFG_ID

This is a unique log file group number of the value 0.

##### CUR_WRITE_LF_NO

This is the number of the log file currently being used to store logs.

##### CUR_WRITE_LF_OFFSET

This is the log file offset currently being used to store logs.

##### LF_OPEN_COUNT

This is the number of log files on disk that are open for use by Altibase.

##### LF_PREPARE_COUNT

This is the number of log files that have been created in advance (prepared) by the log file creation thread up to the present moment

##### LF_PREPARE_WAIT_COUNT

When all of the prepared log files have been used, it is necessary to create new log files. This is the total number of waits for log files to be created in order to switch to a new log file. 

If this value is large, setting the PREPARE_LOG_FILE_COUNT property to a higher value will help ensure that a sufficient number of log files is prepared in advance. For more information about PREPARE_LOG_FILE_COUNT, please refer to the *General Reference*.

##### LST_PREPARE_LF_NO

This is the number of the log file that was most recently prepared (created in advance) by the log file creation thread.

##### END_LSN_FILE_NO

This shows the number of the log file, which is part of the LSN (Log Sequence Number), at which REDO commences when the system is restarted. It can be guaranteed that REDO will definitely begin with a log having a greater LSN value than the one shown here.

##### END_LSN_OFFSET

This shows the offset within the log file, which is part of the LSN (Log Sequence Number), at which REDO commences when the system is restarted. It can be guaranteed that REDO will definitely begin with a log having a greater LSN value than the one shown here.

##### FIRST_DELETED_LOGFILE

This shows the number of the first of the log files that were classified as unnecessary and deleted during checkpointing. This means that the log file having this number was deleted during checkpointing. 

##### LAST_DELETED_LOGFILE

This shows the last log files that were classified as unnecessary and deleted during checkpointing. This number means that the corresponding log file has been deleted during the checkpoint.

##### RESET_LSN_FILE_NO

RESET_LSN is the first LSN after the time point at which recovery was performed. RESET_LSN_FILE_NO is the log file number portion of RESET_LSN.

##### RESET_LSN_OFFSET

This shows the offset within the log file, and is a portion of RESET_LSN.

##### UPDATE_TX_COUNT

This returns, in real time, the number of transactions in the LFG that are currently making changes to the database.

##### GC_WAIT_COUNT

This shows the total number of times transactions in this LFG had to wait for disk I/O for group commit.

##### GC_ALREADY_SYNC_COUNT

During group commit, it is sometimes not necessary to perform disk I/O for some transactions, because the logs containing them have already been written to disk. This is the cumulative number of times this has occurred.

##### GC_REAL_SYNC_COUNT

This shows the number of actual disk I/O operations related to transactions in this LFG during group commit.

Because Altibase supports MVCC, multiple versions of a single record can exist. In other words, one record consists of a most recent version and a number of previous versions. For more detailed information on MVCC, please refer to the sections pertaining to Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) in both the *Altibase* *Administrator’s Manual* and the *Altibase Getting Started Guide*.

##### AGING_REQUEST_OID_CNT

If 10 records are deleted in one transaction, which is then committed, there are now 10 outdated records that can be cleared to recover space. However, because ADD_OID_CNT is determined on the basis of transactions, it is incremented by 1. To remedy this, AGING_REQUEST_OID_CNT, which is determined on the basis of OIDs, is incremented by 10.

##### AGING_PROCESSED_OID_CNT

If the garbage collector (or ager) deletes 10 outdated versions of records from the same OID list, GC_OID_CNT is only incremented by 1 because it determined on the basis of lists. To remedy this, AGING_PROCESSED_OID_CNT, which is determined on the basis of OIDs, is incremented by 10. 

##### THREAD_COUNT

This shows the number of garbage collection threads.

A thread in server process that receives and fulfills request(queries) from clients is called a service thread. Altibase provides the following two modes for the creation of service threads:

-   Dedicated Thread Mode:  
    When a multiple number of clients connect to the server and execute queries, one service thread is created for each client session in order to execute queries.
    
-   Multiplexing Thread Mode:  
    The Altibase server creates only the number of service threads optimized for the server and client sessions share these. 

Altibase is designed to always maintain the optimal number of service threads by dynamically adding or deleting service threads as needed; however, the minimum number of service threads specified in the DEDICATED_THREAD_INIT_COUNT or MULTIPLEXING_THREAD_COUNT property is maintained.

#### Column Information

##### ID

This is the identifier of the service thread. This is an identifier that is managed within Altibase, rather than a system thread identifier (that is, a Light Weight Process ID).

##### TYPE

-   SOCKET (MULTIPLEXING): Connection via TCP or Unix Domain (UDP) 
-   SOCKET (DEDICATED): Connection via TCP or Unix Domain Socket 
-   IPC: Connection via IPC 
-   IPCDA: Connection via IPCDA

##### STATE

This indicates the current status of the service thread. It can have the following values:

-   NONE: The service thread is being initialized. 
-   POLL: The service thread is waiting for an event. 
-   QUEUE-WAIT: The service thread is waiting in the queue. 
-   EXECUTE: The service thread is executing a statement. 
-   UNKNOWN: The status of the service thread cannot be determined.

##### RUN_MODE

This shows the mode of execution of the service thread. It can be either SHARED or DEDICATED.

-   SHARED: The service thread run in multiplexing mode, and one service thread serves multiple client connections.

-   DEDICATED: One client connection is allocated to one service thread, and uses the thread exclusively.

Switching the operating mode of a service thread is currently possible only for queue-related tasks. The mode can only be switched from SHARED mode to DEDICATED mode.

This is the number of Child Plan Cache objects that the SQL Text Plan object currently possesses.

##### CHILD_PCO_CREATE_COUNT

This is the number of Child Plan Caches that have been created in the SQL Text Plan object so far. New Child Plan Cache objects are created in the SQL Text Plan object in the following two cases:

-   A Child Plan Cache object is created when the SQL statement is the same but the environment in which the plan was created has changed. 
-   A new plan cache object is created when objects that refer to the plan cache object have changed, or when the range of statistical information about objects has changed excessively.

##### PLAN_CACHE_KEEP

This shows the keep status of plan cache object corresponding to SQL_TEXT_ID and can have the following values: 

- KEEP
  PLAN is kept and is not selected as victim.
- UNKEEP
  PLAN can be selected as victim with unkeep status.

### V\$USAGE

This view outputs information about the amount of space used by all of the tables and indexes that exist in the database. In order for the information presented in this view to be correct, it is first necessary to execute the built-in DBMS Stat stored procedures to gather statistical information.

For a detailed explanation of the built-in DBMS Stat stored procedures, please refer to the *Stored Procedures Manual*.

| Column name   | Type    | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TYPE          | CHAR(1) | The type of the object                                       |
| TARGET_ID     | BIGINT  | An identifier for the object                                 |
| META_SPACE    | BIGINT  | The amount of space occupied by meta information about the object |
| USED_SPACE    | BIGINT  | The amount of space occupied by the actual data in the object |
| AGEABLE_SPACE | BIGINT  | The amount of space occupied by outdated data that must be retained for concurrency control |
| FREE_SPACE    | BIGINT  | The amount of free space in the object                       |

#### Column Information

##### TYPE

This indicates the type of object. The value is "T" for a table and "I" for an index.

##### TARGET_ID

This is an identifier for the object. For a table, it is TABLE_OID (the table object identifier), whereas for an index it is INDEX_ID. To output the name of the object, use this column to join this table to the SYSTEM_.SYS_TABLES_ meta table using the TABLE_OID column, or to the SYSTEM_.SYS_INDICES_ meta table using the INDEX_ID column.

##### META_SPACE

This is the amount of space used to store the meta information for the object.

##### USED_SPACE

This is the amount of space used to store the actual data contained by the object.

##### AGEABLE_SPACE

Because MVCC is implemented in Altibase, even after data has already been deleted from a table or an index, previous versions of data are maintained for a short time in order to support concurrency control. This column indicates the amount of space occupied by such data.

##### FREE_SPACE

This is the amount of space in the object that has either never been used, or that was used but has since been freed and can be reused.

#### Example

```
iSQL> exec gather_database_stats();
SYSTEM_.SYS_TABLES_
SYSTEM_.SYS_COLUMNS_
SYSTEM_.SYS_DATABASE_
SYSTEM_.SYS_USERS_
SYSTEM_.SYS_DN_USERS_
SYSTEM_.SYS_TBS_USERS_
SYSTEM_.SYS_INDICES_
SYSTEM_.SYS_INDEX_COLUMNS_
