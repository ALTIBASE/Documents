This manual describes command syntax using diagrams composed of the following elements:

| Elements                                                   | Meaning                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![](media/GeneralReference/GeneralReference_eng.1.2.1.jpg) | Indicates the start of a command. If a syntactic element starts with an arrow, it is not a complete command. |
| ![](media/GeneralReference/image006.gif)                   | Indicates that the command continues to the next line. if a syntactic element ends with this symbol, it is not a complete command. |
| ![](media/GeneralReference/image008.gif)                   | Indicates that the command continues from the previous line. If a syntactic element starts with this symbol, it is not a complete command. |
| ![](media/GeneralReference/image010.gif)                   | Indicates the end of a statement.                            |

| ![](media/GeneralReference/image014.gif)                   | Indicates an optional element.                               |
| ![](media/GeneralReference/image016.gif)                   | Indicates a mandatory element comprised of options. One, and only one, option must be specified. |
| ![](media/GeneralReference/image018.gif)                   | Indicates an optional element comprised of options.          |
| ![](media/GeneralReference/image020.gif)                   | Indicates an optional element in which multiple elements may be specified. A comma must precede all but the first element. |

##### Sample Code Conventions

The code examples explain SQL, stored procedures, iSQL, and other command line syntax.

The following describes the conventions used in the code examples:

| Rules            | Meaning                                                      | Example                                                      |

## 1. Data Types

In order to use SQL to store, change, and query the data in a database, it is first necessary to possess a thorough understanding of the available data types. This chapter presents a detailed explanation of the data types supported in Altibase.

### Overview

#### Data Type Overview

The following data types are supported in Altibase:

##### Character Data Types

<table>
    <tr>
    	<td colspan="3">M: Defined column length<br/>L: The length of the input string
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<th>Type</th>
        <th>Length</th>
        <th>Size</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>CHAR(M)</td>
        <td>1 ~ 32000</td>
        <td>M + 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>VARCHAR(M)</td>
        <td>1 ~ 32000</td>
        <td>length + 2, where
length = L if the input value is stored in a variable area
length = M if the input value is stored in a fixed area
</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
    	<td>NCHAR(M)</td>
        <td>1~16000(UTF16)
1~10666(UTF8)
</td>
        <td>M*2 + 2(UTF16)
M*3 + 2(UTF8)
</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
    	<td>NVARCHAR(M)</td>
        <td>1~16000(UTF16)
1~10666(UTF8)
</td>
        <td>length*2 + 2(UTF16)
length*2 + 2(UTF16)
length*3 + 2(UTF8)
where:
length = L if the input value is stored in a variable area
length = M if the input value is stored in a fixed area
</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

NCHAR and NVARCHAR are Unicode character types. The available maximum length of a UTF16-encoded string is different from that of a UTF8-encoded string.

###### Example 1

Fixed-Point Numbers Size Calculation: 

( 3 + ( ( p ) + 2 ) / 2 )

```
- NUMERIC  
  NUMERIC(38, 0): Size = 3 + 40/2 = 23 bytes

- NUMERIC(p) / NUMERIC(p, 0)  
  NUMERIC(10): Size = 3 + 12/2 = 9 bytes

- NUMERIC(p, s)  
  NUMERIC(10, 9): Size = 3 + 12/2 = 9 bytes
  
- DECIMAL: the same as NUMERIC
— DECIMAL(p): the same as NUMERIC(p)
— DECIMAL(p,s): the same as NUMERIC(p,s)
— NUMBER(p): the same as NUMERIC(p)
— NUMBER(p,s): the same as NUMERIC(p,s)
```

###### Example 2

Floating-Point Numbers Size Calculation: ( 3 + ( ( p ) + 2 ) / 2 )

```
- FLOAT  
  FLOAT(38): Size = 3 + 40/2 = 23 bytes
  
- FLOAT(p)  
  FLOAT(20): Size = 3 + 22/2 = 14 bytes
  
- - NUMBER: the same as FLOAT
```

**Date Data Type**

| Type | Size (byte) |
| ---- | ----------- |
| DATE | 8           |

**Geomerty Data Type**

| Type     | Length       | Size (byte) |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| GEOMETRY | 8\~104857600 | length + 40 |

The actual record size is the size of each data type as indicated above, plus the size of header information. The size of the header information varies depending on the OS.

#### NULL

When a row is inserted into a table, the value of a column is set to NULL if the value for that column is not known or has not been determined yet. In other words, NULL indicates that no value exists. Therefore, NULL is not the same as 0 (zero) or blank space, and is handled differently when performing comparison operations or saving data.

If any operation other than the NVL() function or the IS NULL or IS NOT NULL conditions is performed on a NULL value, the final result of the formula containing the operation will be NULL. In other words, comparisons and operations are meaningless when performed on NULL values.

NULL can appear in columns of any data type, as long as they are not restricted by NOT NULL or PRIMARY KEY constraints.

#### Data Type Conversion

The data type conversions that are possible are shown in matrix form in the following table.

When a comparison operation is to be performed on two values having the same data type, the comparison operation is performed on the values directly without any prior conversion. In contrast, when a comparison operation is to be performed on two values having different data types, the comparison is performed after one of the values is converted into the same type as the other value. Note however that when comparisons are performed, character data types are always converted into the data type of the other comparison operand, not the other way around

The following table shows convertible matrices of implicit data types (O: shows that attributes are retained even when data types are converted). For more detailed information on how to convert an existing table's data type to MODIFY, please refer to *modify_column_clause* statement in the *SQL Reference*.

##### Implicit Data Type Conversion

If '1000' of bit type is entered into table t10 table, the conversion succeeds to integer '1000', but it is not an implicit data type conversion because the attribute of data type is changed.

```
iSQL> create table t10 (i1 integer);
Create success.
iSQL> insert into t10 values (bit'1000');
1 row inserted.
iSQL> select * from t10;
I1
--------------
1000
1 row selected.
```

Therefore, implicit data type conversion follows the rules below:

- When comparing numeric or character data types or arithmetic operations, the character data types are converted to numeric data types.
- When comparing the date data type with the character data type, the character data type is converted to the date data type and the comparison opertion is performed.
- Operation that cannot convert data types are invalidated.
- The argument used in the function is converted to the data type of the argument defined in the function.
- If a character data type or numeric data type that uses decimal precisions to a floating-point data type that uses binary precision is converted
- When executing an INSERT or UPDATE, the data type is converted to the data type of the INSERT and UPDATE columns. 

##### Example

\<Query> When comparing numeric data types, character data type '10' is converted to numeric data.

```
iSQL> create table emp (empno integer, name varchar(10), hire_date date);
insert into emp values (10,'altibase', '10-nov-2015');

iSQL> select name from emp where empno = '10';
NAME
--------------
altibase
1 row selected.
```

\<Query> When arithmetic between numeric data type and character data type, character data type '10' is converted to numeric data type.

```
iSQL> select empno + '10' from emp;
EMPNO+'10'
-------------------------
20
1 row selected.
```

\<Query> When comparing a date date type with a character data type, the character data type '10-nov-2015' is converted to a date data type.

```
iSQL> select hire_date from emp where hire_date = '10-nov-2015';
HIRE_DATE
---------------
10-NOV-2015
1 row selected.
```

\<Query> When arithmetic between numeric data type and character type is performed, binary data type cannot be converted to numeric data type and operation is invalidated.

```
iSQL> select empno + cast(12345 as nibble(6)) from emp;
[ERR-2100C : Conversion not applicable.
0001 : select EMPNO + CAST(12345 as NIBBLE(6)) from EMP
             ^                               ^
]
```

\<Query> When the function SUM receives the character data type '10' as an argument, it is converted.

```
iSQL> select sum('10') from dual;
SUM('10')
--------------
10
1 row selected.
```

\<Query> When the character data type '12.123456789' is converted to a floating-point numeric data type, the number of significant digits becomes float (11), which causes a loss of value.

```
iSQL> select float'12.123456789' from dual;
FLOAT'12.123456789'
----------------------
12.1234568
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\> The value of numeric data to be inserted is converted according to the data type of the column to be inserted and the value is INSERT.

```
iSQL>  create table t1 ( i1 char(10), i2 integer, i3 double);
Create success.
iSQL>  insert into t1 values (integer'1020', char'1928', float'123.1234');
1 row inserted.
iSQL>     select * from t1;
I1          I2          I3
---------------------------------------------------
1020        1928        123.1234
1 row selected.
```

#### Explicit Data Type Conversion

Data type conversion can be explicitly performed using SQL conversion functions or by type-casting, as shown below. The SQL functions that are used to explicitly convert a value from one data type to another are explained in the *SQL Reference*.

##### Syntax

```
datatype 'string or constant literal '
```

##### Description

Explicitly converts a numeric value from on data type to another. In the following example, the number 157.27 is converted to the characters "157.27".

```
CHAR '157.27'
```

#### Using the Character Strings

Single quotation mark should be used when displaying character strings in a SQL query. Since the single quoration mark becomes an escape letter when displaying a single quotation mark ('), the single quotation mark should be used in font.

##### Example

```
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE NAME = ’KIM’;
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (‘GILDONG’’’);//Insert the value GILDONG'
SELECT * FROM REMOTE_TABLE(link1, ‘SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE NAME=‘’KIM‘’’; //''are not the double quotation mark, it is two single quotation marks
```

#### FIXED/VARIABLE Option

FIXED or VARIABLE specifies where the data in a column will be stored.

When an entire record is stored in a contiguous space, this is called a 'FIXED' area. When one of the columns is stored in a separated space, rather than being stored in the fixed area contiguous with the rest of the record, this column is said to be stored in a 'VARIABLE' area.

When a column is stored in a variable area, the header information for the column, such as the length of the data and the pointer to the actual data, is stored in the fixed area, whereas the data for that column are stored in the variable area.

When a table is created in a disk tablespace, whether the user specifies FIXED or VARIABLE is ignored, and all columns in the table are treated as FIXED. However, when a table is created in a memory table space, the user-specified value is used.

However, the exception to this is that all LOB data type columns are always treated as VARIABLE, and the data can thus be stored in a fixed or variable area depending on the value specified using the IN ROW clause.

The following data types can be specified as VARIABLE: CHAR, VARCHAR, NCHAR, NVARCHAR, BYTE, VARBATE, NIBBLE, BIT, VARBIT, BLOB, and CLOB

#### IN ROW Clause

This clause pertains only to column data that are to be stored in a variable area. If the FIXED and IN ROW clause are both specified when a table is created, the IN ROW clause is ignored. When data are entered into a VARIABLE column, if the length of the data is less than or equal to the value specified using the IN ROW clause, the data will be stored in the fixed area, whereas if the data length is greated than the value specified using the IN ROW clause, the data will be sotred in the variable area.

Here, "data length" does not mean the length of the input data, but the length of the data to be sotred in memory or on disk, which will be somewhat larger. For example, when a column is defined as "VARCHAR(400) in row 200", data will be inserted into the fixed area if the length of the data that is input is smaller than or equal to 198, because 2 additional bytes are required when storing the data.

The default size of lob data stored in the fixed area can be specified using the MEMORY_LOB_COLUMN_IN_ROW_SIZE property for memory tables and the DISK_LOB_COLUMN_IN_ROW_SIZE for disk tables. Additionally, the default size for columns containing other types of data with the VARIABLE option can be specified using the MEMORY_VARIABLE_COLUMN_IN_ROW_SIZE property. 

Setting these properties eliminates the need to use the IN ROW clause repeatedly for each column when creating a table. For more detailed information about these properties, please refer to chapter 2.

### Character Data Types

Character data types are used to store character (alphanumeric) data, meaning words or free-form text, in either the database character set or the national character set.

In Altibase, character data typers comprise the following types:

- CHAR
- VARCHAR
- NCHAR
- NVARCHAR

#### CHAR

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/242f2c3edb0f197d371a4ec74f665ba8.jpg)

##### Syntax

```
CHAR [(size)] [ FIXED | VARIABLE [IN ROW size] ]
```

##### Description

Tihs is a character data type that has a fixed length equal to the specified size. If an input value is shorter than the specified size, the remaining area is filled with blank spaces.

The default size of CHAR column is 1byte, and its maximum length is 32000 bytes.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW clauses" section above.

#### VARCHAR

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/f7552045fb1b327e02cba948bbafeb3f.jpg)

##### Syntax

```
VARCHAR [(size)] [ FIXED | VARIABLE [IN ROW size] ]
```

##### Description

This is a character data type for storing alphanumeric data that vary in length within a specified size.

The default size of VARCHAR column is 1byte, and its maximum length is 32000 bytes.

VARCHAR is a variable length data type; that is, when the length of input data is shorter than the specified column size, only the data that were actually inserted are stored. In contrast, for the CHAR data type, if the length of input data is shorter than the column length, the remaining space in the column is padded with blank spaces. For example, if a column is defined as CHAR(10) and the word “magic” is to be stored, it will be stored as “magic_____”, where “_” represents a blank space.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" section above.

#### NCHAR

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/479310aaf34bada9e78bf3bb9c18eb8c.jpg)

##### Syntax

```
NCHAR [(size)] [ FIXED | VARIABLE [IN ROW size] ]
```

##### Description 

This is a character data type having a specified fixed length. If an input value is shorter than the specified size, the remainder is filled with blank spaces.

If the national character set is UTF16, the size of one character in an NCHAR column is fixed at 2 bytes, that is, it does not vary in length. In contrast, if the national character set is UTF8, the size of one character in an NCHAR column is not fixed; rather, it varies from 1 to 3 bytes.

The maximum size is 16000 bytes if the national character set is UTF16.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" section above.

#### NVARCHAR

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/bdc39809efd5cc54b1ee2b06d2dd638b.jpg)

##### Syntax

```
NVARCHAR [(size)] [ FIXED | VARIABLE [IN ROW size] ]
```

##### Description

This is a character data type for storing Unicode alphanumeric data that vary in length within a specified size.

If the national character set is UTF16, the size of one character in an NVARCHAR column is fixed at 2 bytes, that is, it does not vary in length. In contrast, if the national character set is UTF8, the size of one character in an NVARCHAR column is not fixed; rather, it varies from 1 to 3 bytes.

In other aspects, the NVARCHAR type is the same as the VARCHAR type, so for more detailed information please refer to the description of the VARCHAR type.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" section above.

### Numeric Data Types

Numeric data types are used to store zero as well as positive and negative numbers having fixed values. Altibase supports the following numeric types:

- BIGINT
- DECIMAL
- DOUBLE
- FLOAT
- INTEGER
- NUMBER
- NUMERIC
- REAL
- SMALLINT

#### BIGINT

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/bigint1.png)

##### Syntax

```
BIGINT
```

##### Description

This is an 8-byte integer data type.

It is equivalent to the “long” (on 64-bit systems) and “long long” (on 32-bit systems) types in the C language.

Range: -2<sup>63</sup> + 1(-9223372036854775807) \~ 2<sup>63</sup> – 1(9223372036854775807)

#### DECIMAL

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/decimal1.png)

##### Syntax

```
DECIMAL [(precision[, scale])]
```

##### Description

This data type is the same as the NUMERIC type.

#### DOUBLE

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/double1.png)

##### Syntax

```
DOUBLE
```

##### Description

This is an 8-byte floating-point numeric data type. 

It is the same as the “double” type in the C language.

#### FLOAT

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/float1.png)

##### Syntax

```
FLOAT [(precision)]
```

##### Description

This is a floating-point numeric data type that can store a value ranging from -1E+120 to 1E+120. 

Precision is the number of significant digits, that is, the number of digits used to express the mantissa of the floating-point number. 

Precision can range from 1 to 38. If it is not expressly specified, the default precision is 38. 

#### INTEGER

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/integer1.png)

##### Syntax

```
INTEGER
```

##### Description

This is an integer data type that is 4 bytes in size. 

It is the same as the “int” data type in the C language. 

It can have an integer value ranging from -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647.

#### NUMBER

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/number1.png)

##### Syntax

```
NUMBER [(precision, scale)]
```

##### Description

This is an alias of the NUMERIC data type. However, when precision and scale are not defined, they are the same as for the FLOAT data type. The FLOAT data type is rounded to the 39th digit.

#### NUMERIC

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/numberic1.png)

##### Syntax

```
NUMERIC [(precision, scale)]
```

##### Description

NUMERIC is a fixed decimal data type that can contain a total number of significant digits up to the value specified using precision and a number of digits to the right of the decimal place up to the value specified using scale. In contrast to the FLOAT data type, which is a floating-point numerical data type used for representing real numbers, when both precision and scale are omitted from a NUMERIC data type declaration, precision defaults to 38 and scale to 0, i.e. 

-  Precision can be specified within the range from 1 to 38. 
- Scale can be specified within the range from -84 to 128. 
- If precision is omitted, the default is 38. 
- If scale is omitted, the default is 0.

The following shows the respective values that would result when the input value 1234567.89 is converted to the NUMERIC types defined as shown.

-  NUMERIC=> 1234568 
- NUMERIC(9)=> 1234568 
- NUMERIC(9, 2)=> 1234567.89 
- NUMERIC(9, 1)=> 1234567.9 
- NUMERIC(6)=> Precision exceeded 
- NUMERIC(7, -2)=> 1234500 
- NUMERIC(7, 2)=> Precision exceeded

#### REAL

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/real1.png)

##### Syntax

```
REAL
```

##### Description

The data type is used to store 4-byte floating-point numeric values.

It is the same as the “float” type in the C language.

#### SMALLINT

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/smallint1.png)

##### Syntax

```
SMALLINT
```

##### Description

This data type is used to store 2-byte integer values.

It is the same as the "short" type in the C language.

It can be used to store integers ranging from -2<sup>15</sup> + 1(-32,767)에서 2<sup>15</sup> - 1(32,767) inclusive

#### Number Format Model

When data are converted using typecasting functions such as TO_CHAR or TO_NUMBER, numeric data can be specified in the following formats. A number format model consists of one or more elements that represent a number. In this section, each of these elements will be explained with reference to examples showing the related number formats. 

##### , (Comma)

###### Descriptions

Outputs a comma at the specified position.

Commas can be used multiple times.

###### Restriction

A comman cannot be placed at the end of a number, to the right of a decimal point, or at the very beginning of a number.

###### Example

```
iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR (1234, '99,99') FROM dual;
TO_CHAR (1234, '99,99')  
---------------------------
 12,34           
1 row selected.

iSQL> SELECT TO_NUMBER ( '12,34', '99,99') FROM dual;
TO_NUMBER ( '12,34', '99,99') 
--------------------------------
1234        
1 row selected.
```

##### . (Decimal Point)

###### Description

Adds a decimal point at the specified position

###### Restriction

Only one decimal point can be used within a number

###### Example

```
iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR (1.234, '99.999') FROM dual;
TO_CHAR (1.234, '99.999')  
-----------------------------
  1.234          
1 row selected.

iSQL> SELECT TO_NUMBER ( '1.234', '99.999') FROM dual;
TO_NUMBER ( '1.234', '99.999') 
---------------------------------
1.234       
1 row selected.
```

##### \$

###### Description

Prepends the $ sign to a number

###### Example

```
iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR (123, '$9999') FROM dual;
TO_CHAR (123, '$9999')  
--------------------------
  $123           
1 row selected.

iSQL> SELECT TO_NUMBER ( '$0123', '09$99') FROM dual;
TO_NUMBER ( '$0123', '09$99') 
--------------------------------
123         
1 row selected.
```

##### 0(Numeral 0)

###### Description

If the number of significant digits to be output exceeds the number of digits in the number that is input, 0's (zeroes) are prepended to the number before it is returned. In all other aspects, this element is the same as the “9” element, which is described below.

###### Example

```
iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR (123, '0999') FROM dual;
TO_CHAR (123, '0999')  
-------------------------
 0123
```

##### 9(Numeral 9)

###### Description

Uses the numeral 9 to indicate the number of digits to output. If the number of 9's is greater than the number of digits in the number that is input, the space to the left of the number is padded with blank spaces before the number is output. If the number of 9's to the left of the decimal point is less than the number of digits to the left of the decimal point in the input number, the pound sign (“#”) is repeatedly output. The number of pound signs that are output is the number of characters in the user-defined format plus one (a sign character). A decimal point placed in between 9's separates the integer and fractional parts of a number

When there are digits to the right of the decimal point in the first argument, i.e. when the input number has a fractional part, but the user-defined format either has no fractional part or has a fractional part with a smaller number of decimal places than the input number, the input number is rounded off to the number of decimal places in the user-defined format

###### Example

```
iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR (123, '99999') FROM dual;
TO_CHAR (123, '99999')  
--------------------------
   123

iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR (123.55, '999') FROM dual;
TO_CHAR (123.55, '999')  
---------------------------
 124             
1 row selected.

iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR (123.4567, '999999') FROM dual;
TO_CHAR (123.4567, '999999')  
--------------------------------
    123          
1 row selected.

iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR (1234.578, '9999.99') FROM dual;
TO_CHAR (1234.578, '9999.99')  
---------------------------------

### Date Data Type

The DATE type is used to store date and time information

#### DATE

###### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/date1.png)

###### Syntax

```
DATE
```

###### Description

This data type is used to store date values in 8 bytes.

The range of dates that can be stored depends on the system. Typically, the dates that can be stored range from 0001/01/01 - 9999/12/31.

The date value can be displayed in various formats using a date format string.

#### The Datetime Formal Model

The date data type is managed as numerical data d it is internally managed by the database. However, it can be displayed with character strings with the conversion function TO_CHAR or TO_DATE. The user should specify a character string of the date data type in accordance with a report format when using conversion functions.

The date data types are comprised of the following basic elements.

- AM, PM
- SCC, CC
- D, DD, DDD, DAY,DY
- HH, HH12, HH24
- MM, MON, MONTH
- MI
- Q
- SS, SSSSS, SSSSSS, SSSSSSSS, FF[1..6]
- WW, WW2, W, IW
- Y,YYY
- SYYYY, YYYY, YYY, YY, Y, RR, RRRR
- IYYY, IYY, IY, I

Along with these basic elements, the datetime format model also consists of the following punctuation marks and special characters:

- Hyphen (-) 
- Slash (/) 
- Comma (,) 
- Period (.) 
- Colon (:) 
- Single Quotation (‘) 

The meaning and use of each of these basic elements will be explained below with reference to examples.

### Binary Types

Large and unstructured data such as text, images, video, and spatial data can be stored as binary data. Altibase supports the following binary types:

- BYTE
- VARBYTE
- NIBBLE
- BIT
- VARBIT

#### BYTE

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/byte1.png)

##### Syntax

```
BYTE [(size)] [[FIXED |] VARIABLE ( IN ROW size ) ]
```

###### Description

The BYTE is a binary data type containing a specified length. The right space of inserted data is filled with '0' if a character string with a shorter length, which is shorter than the specified the length, is inserted. 

The default size of a BYTE column is 1 byte. The maximum length of a BYTE column is 32000 bytes. The data can be expressed in hexadecimal format using a combination of alphabet and numeric characters, such as '0FAE13.' The allowable alphanumeric characters are 0 (zero) to 9 and A to F. 

The specified size should be adjusted when executing data retrieval or entering the BYTE column. Two characters can be inserted in a byte; for example, if BYTE(3) is defined, values ranging from ‘000000’ to ‘FFFFFF’ can be inserted. 

In the case of inserting the lower case letters from 'a' from 'f', they are stored as being converted.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" sections above.

###### Example

```
iSQL> CREATE TABLE T1 (I1 BYTE(1), I2 BYTE(5));
Create success.
iSQL> INSERT INTO T1 VALUES (BYTE'11', BYTE'0011');
1 row inserted.
iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR(I1), TO_CHAR(I2) FROM T1;
TO_CHAR(I1)  TO_CHAR(I2)  
-----------------------------
11  0011000000  
1 row selected.
```

#### VARBYTE 

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/varbyte1.png)

##### Syntax

```
VARBYTE [(size)] [[FIXED |] VARIABLE ( IN ROW size ) ]
```

##### Description

This is a binary data type containing a variable length. The default size of a VARBYTE column is one byte, and its maximum size is 32000 bytes.

The data can be expressed through a hexadecimal format with combination of alphabets and numbers such as ‘0FAE13’. The allocable alphabet and numeric characters range from 0 to 9 and A to F. The specified size should be adjusted when executing data retrieval or entering the BYTE column.

Two characters can be inserted in a byte; for example, if BYTE(3) is defined, values ranging from ‘000000’ to ‘FFFFFF’ can be inserted. In the case of inserting the lower case letters from 'a' from 'f', they are stored as being converted.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" sections above.

##### Example

```
iSQL> CREATE TABLE T1 (I1 VARBYTE(1), I2 VARBYTE(5) );
Create success.
iSQL> INSERT INTO T1 VALUES (VARBYTE'11', VARBYTE'0011');
1 row inserted.
iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR(I1), TO_CHAR(I2) FROM T1;
TO_CHAR(I1)  TO_CHAR(I2)  
-----------------------------
11  0011        
1 row selected.
```

#### NIBBLE

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/nibble1.png)

##### Syntax

```
NIBBLE [(size)] [[FIXED |] VARIABLE ( IN ROW size ) ]
```

##### Description

NIBBLE column is that of a single character, and the maximum size is 254nibbles. 

The data can be expressed in hexadecimal format using a combination of alphabet and numeric characters. The allowable alphanumeric characters are 0 (zero) to 9 and A to F. Unlike the BYTE type, only one character can be entered into one nibble. 

For example, for NIBBLE (6), '000000' to 'FFFFFF' can be inserted. 

When the lower case letters 'a' through 'f' are input, they are converted into upper-case letters.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" sections above.

#### BIT

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/bit1.png)

##### Syntax

```
BIT [(size)] [[FIXED |] VARIABLE ( IN ROW size ) ]
```

##### Description

This is a binary data type that has a fixed length and consists only of 0's and 1's. 

The default size of a BIT column is one bit. Its maximum size is 64000 bits. 

If an attempt is made to input a string that is longer than the specified length, an 'Invalid data type length' error will be raised. If a string shorter than the specified length is input, the space to the right of the input data is populated with 0's. If a value other than 0 or 1 is input, an 'Invalid literal' error is raised.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" sections above.

##### Example

```
iSQL> CREATE TABLE T1 ( I1 BIT(1), I2 BIT(5) );

[ERR-21011 : Invalid literal]
```

### LOB Data Type

#### Overview

The LOB (which stands for Large Object) data type is for holding large amounts of data. Up to 2 GB can be stored in one column of LOB data. Unlike other data types, the length of a LOB column does not need to be specified when a table is created. Additionally, more than one LOB type column can be defined in a table.

The LOB data type is divided into the Binary Large Object (BLOB) type, which is for holding binary data such as image and video files, and the Character Large Object (CLOB) type, which is for holding string data.

#### The Features of LOB

The LOB data type provided with Altibase has the following features:

- Data Sotrage Functions
- Partial Read
- Disk LOB Partitioning

##### Features of LOB

The LOB data type provided with Altibase has the following features:

* Data Storage Functions 
* Partial Read 
* Disk LOB Partitioning

##### Partial Read

It is possible to read only a desired portion of LOB data. A specific amount of data, offset a specific distance from the beginning of the file, can be read using the SQLGetLob function in Altibase ODBC.

##### Disk LOB Partitioning

Disk LOB data can be stored in a disk tablespace other than the one in which the table is stored. This tablespace can be configured in a method similar to partitioning. 

#### Storing LOB Columns

In most cases, LOB data are stored in a variable area, away from the rest of the record. However, if a small amount of data is stored in the LOB column, the column can be stored in an area that is contiguous with the rest of the record (i.e. in the fixed area) using the 'in row' option. Note that this is possible for memory tables only; regardless of their size, LOB data in disk tables are always stored in a separate, variable area.

Because the amount of LOB column data that is stored in the variable area is typically very large, storing it in the same tablespace as the rest of the record has a negative impact on the efficiency of usage of space. 

In a disk table, LOB column data can be stored in a tablespace other than the one containing the table to which the LOB column belongs. However, in a memory table, LOB column data cannot be stored separately, and thus are stored in the same tablespace as the table. 

#### BLOB

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/blob1.png)

##### Syntax

```
BLOB [ VARIABLE ( IN ROW size ) ]
```

##### Description

BLOB is a binary data type that can vary in length up to 4GB-1bye and is intedned for use in storing large amounts of binary data.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" sections above.

#### CLOB

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/clob1.png)

##### Syntax

```
CLOB [ VARIABLE ( IN ROW size ) ]
```

##### Description

CLOB is a character data type that can vary in length up to 4GB-bye  and is intended for use in storing large amounts of character data.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" sections above.

#### Restriction

- LOB type columns can't be used with cursors. 
- LOB type columns can't be used in volatile tables or disk temporary tablespaces. 
- LOB columns associated with tables in discarded tablespaces cannot be accessed. 
- LOB type columns cannot be used for partitioning conditions, because in order to partition a column it must be possible to perform comparisons on the data in the column. 
- Indexes cannot be created for LOB columns. 
- It is possible to define a NOT NULL constraint for a LOB type column. However, when an insert attempt is made, a constraint violation error may be raised while the Altibase server is internally processing the data. Therefore, it is recommended that the NOT NULL constraint not be used with LOB type columns.

### Spatial Types

The only geometry data type that is defined and supported for use with SQL in Altibase is the GEOMETRY data type. The Geometry data type consists of the following seven subtypes:

- Point
- LineString
- Polygon
- GeomCollection
- MultiPolygon
- MultiLineString
- MultiPoint

For more detailed information information about the geometry datatype, please refer to the *Spatial SQL Refernce*.

## 2. Altibase Properties

Altibase server can be run in various modes. The altibase.properties file is used to set Altibase server environment settings. The altibase.properties file contains all elements related to the operation and adjustment of the Altibase server.

This chapter describes the Altibase properties that need to be set and managed to configure and operate Altibase as a database suitable for the user's purposes.

### Configuration

There are three ways to set Altibase server environment settings. 

The first method involves making changes to the Altibase properties file, which is located at $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf/altibase.properties. Because this method of configuration is static, meaning that changes can only be made while Altibase is not running, the Altibase instance must be restarted in order for the changes to the properties file to take effect.

The second method is dynamic, meaning that configuration changes can be made even while Altibase server is running. Although this method confers the advantage of being able to make and apply changes without shutting down the server, it is not possible for all properties. For properties that can be dynamically changed, the ALTER SYSTEM or ALTER SESSION statements can be used to apply the configuration changes to the entire Altibase server or to individual sessions, respectively.

The third method of configuring the Altibase environment is through the use of operating system environment variables. Like the method involving the altibase.properties file, this configuration method is also static. Properties that are read-only or that can only have a single value can be set in this way. After specifying the environment variable as ALTIBASE_property_name, it will be necessary to reboot the database server in order to implement the changes.

Here is an example.

```
$ export ALTIBASE_DEFAULT_DATE_FORMAT=YYYY/MM/DD
```

The precedence of the property-setting methods is as follows:

1. Environment variable settings
2. altibase.properties file settings
3. Default system values

As can be seen in the following example, when properties are set, because environment variables take highest precedence, the value of DEFAULT_DATE_FORMAT in the altibase.properties file is ignored, and the value of the environment variable is used.

```
$ export ALTIBASE_DEFAULT_DATE_FORMAT=YYYY-MM-DD
DEFAULT_DATE_FORMAT=YYYY-MM-DD (altibase.properties)
```

Similarly, in the following example, NLS_USE in the altibase.properties file is ignored, and UTF-8, which is specified by the NLS_USE environment variable, is used, because environment variables have the highest priority.

```
$ export ALTIBASE_NLS_USE=UTF8
NLS_USE=KO16KSC5601 (altibase.properties)
```

### Properties Overview

The property file for configuring the Altibase server is called "altibase.properties" and is located in the conf subdirectory of ALTIBASE_HOME. The properties therein are broadly grouped as follows:

- Database initialization properties
- Performance properties
- Session properties
- Transaction properties
- Backup and recovery properties
- Replication properties
- Network and security properties
- Message logging properties
- Database link properties
- Auditing properties
- C/C++ external procedure agent properties
- User account security properties
- Other properties

The following table lists all Altibase properties. For reference, each group in the table has the following meaning:

- D: Database initialization properties
- P: Performance properties
- S: Session properties
- T: Transaction properties
- B: Backup and recovery properties
- R: Replication properties
- NM: Network Management and security properties
- M: Message logging properties
- L: Database link properties
- U: Auditing properties
- A: C/C++ external procedure agent properties
- AS: Account Security properties
- E: Other properties

The values in the “Alter Level” column have the following meaning:

- SESSION: the property can be changed using an ALTER SESSION statement. 

- SYSTEM: the property can be changed using an ALTER SYSTEM statement. 

- BOTH: the property can be changed using either an ALTER SESSION or an ALTER SYSTEM statement

- NONE: Cannot be changed

In this chapter, each property is explained as follows:

- Property name 
- Data type 
- Default value 
- Attributes (e.g. read-only vs. read-write, single vs. multiple values) 
- Range (maximum and minimum possible values) 
- Description

### Database Initialization Properties

#### BUFFER_AREA_CHUNK_SIZE (Unit: byte)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Long

##### Default Value

33554432 (32M)

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[8192, 2<sup>64</sup>-1]

##### Description

This indicates the unit, in bytes, by which the buffer size is incremented. When the buffer size is increased, it is increased in multiples of this number. This property can’t be changed while the server is running.

#### BUFFER_AREA_SIZE (Unit: byte)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Long

##### Default Value

134217728 (128M)

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[8192, 2<sup>64</sup>-1]

##### Description

This indicates the total memory size, in bytes, used by the buffer pool of Altibase. The value specified by the user will be rounded up to the nearest multiple of BUFFER_AREA_CHUNK_SIZE.
The size of the buffer pool is governed by the size of the page that can be used by a single transaction and the number of transactions executing at the same time. Therefore, when modifying the property that is related to the number of pages or the DISK_INDEX_BUILD_MERGE_PAGE_COUNT property, the BUFFER_AREA_SIZE property shouldn’t be too small.

#### BUFFER_CHECKPOINT_LIST_CNT 

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

4

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 64]

##### Description

This indicates the number of checkpoint lists. The greater the number of checkpoint lists, the less lock contention there is among transactions.

#### BUFFER_FLUSH_LIST_CNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 64]

##### Description

This indicates the number of flush lists. The more flush lists there are, the less lock contention there is among transactions.

#### BUFFER_FLUSHER_CNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

2

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 16]

##### Description

This indicates the number of buffer flushers. This parameter can’t be changed while the server is running.

#### BUFFER_HASH_BUCKET_DENSITY

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 100]

##### Description

This indicates the percentage of BCBs (Buffer Control Blocks) that can be contained in one bucket. For example, when the number of BCBs is 100, if this value is set to 1, lock contention is minimized because the number of buckets is the same as the number of buffer frames in the buffer pool. If this value is set to 2, the number of buckets is half the number of frames, whereas if this value is set to 100, there is only one bucket. As this value is increased, less memory is used; however, operational costs increase because a single bucket will manage more buffer frames.

#### BUFFER_HASH_CHAIN_LATCH_DENSITY

##### Data type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 100]

##### Description

This sets the percentage of buckets that correspond to each latch in a hash table. For example, when the number of buckets is 1000, if this value is 1, one latch corresponds to ten buckets. If this value is 2, twenty buckets share a single latch. If this value is 100, only one latch exists for the entire hash table

This property is used to control concurrency when inserting a BCB (Buffer Control Block) into a hash table or deleting it therefrom. The more latches there are, the less hash chain latch contention will occur.

#### BUFFER_LRU_LIST_CNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

7

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 64]

##### Description

This indicates the number of LRU lists. LRU list lock contention among transactions decreases as this value is increased.

#### BUFFER_PREPARE_LIST_CNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

7

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 64]

##### Description

This indicates the number of prepare lists. The greater this value is, the less prepare list lock contention there is among transactions.

##### Description

This property can minimize the space occupied by data of variable-length columns, when the data is temporarily stored in the memory tablespace.

The disk temporary tablespace is where the Altibase server temporarily stores intermediate results by default, when processing queries on disk tables or views. To enhance performance, intermediate results can be stored in the memory tablespace, using the TEMP_TBS_MEMORY  hint(please refer to Administrator's Manual and *Performance Tuning Guide*).

The default value 0 can occupy unnecessary space, due to data of variable-length columns using temporary storage space of a fixed length, as data of fixed-length columns do. To reduce such waste of space, this property can be set to 1 and only as much space as the actual data of the variable-length column is used. While memory usage is smaller, however, the speed of query processing can slow down.

0: The variable-length columns use as much temporary storage space as the length defined.

1: The variable-length columns use as much temporary storage space as the actual data.

The value of this property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

  To use direct I/O, set this parameter to 1, or to use buffered I/O, set it to 0. 

  The advantage of Direct I/O is that it reduces CPU resources during the occurrence of Disk I/O. On the other hand, since buffered I/O uses the read-ahead and asynchronous write techniques, it does not necessarily incur disk access every time disk I/O is requested. This means that buffered I/O can realize better performance than direct I/O from the aspect of client applications; however, buffered I/O consumes more CPU resources than direct I/O.

##### Description

This property is used to prevent abnormal increases in memory usage due to versioning when large-volume UPDATE batch tasks are performed on memory tables. If the size of logs created by a DML statement increases beyond the value specified in this property, so-called “in-place update”<sup>6</sup> is performed without versioning in order to prevent increased memory usage.

[<sup>6</sup>] In-place update” means directly updating the value of a column in an original record without creating another version of the record.

When using versioning while updating records, an X lock is placed on the record, and an IX lock is placed on the table. However, when in-place update is performed, an X lock, that is, an exclusive lock, is placed on the table. Therefore, care must be taken when setting this value as it can degrade the scalability of the corresponding table if the value is set too low.

The value of this property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### MULTIPLEXING_CHECK_INTERVAL(Unit: microsecond)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

200000

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[100000, 10000000]

##### Description

This property indicates the interval at which sessions are checked, so that the thread manager service thread can be distributed. It is expressed in units of microseconds. 

The thread manger periodically checks the status of threads, updates statistical data, and adds and deletes service threads.

#### MULTIPLEXING_MAX_THREAD_COUNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1024

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 1024]

##### Description

This is the maximum number of multiplex threads.

If the capacity of existing threads is exceeded, new threads are automatically added. However, because performance can suffer if new threads are continually created, care must be taken to set this property appropriately.

Nevertheless, when queuing (QUEUE) is used, a number of threads exceeding the value specified by this property can be created.

#### MULTIPLEXING_THREAD_COUNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

The number of CPUs in the host

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 1024]

##### Description

This is the minimum number of shared service threads that Altibase keeps running. The default is the number of CPUs. 

This parameter cannot be changed after the server has been started.

#### NORMALFORM_MAXIMUM

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

2048

##### Range

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property specifies the maximum number of normal form nodes when normalizing a condition clause.

When the predicates in a WHERE statement of a SELECT query are complicated by the use of logical operators (AND, OR), Altibase normalizes the predicates so that the table(s) can be searched more quickly. 

There are two normalization methods: Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF). If the use of either of these normal forms results in the number of nodes specified here being exceeded, no attempt to perform normalization using that normal form is made.

If both of the normal forms exceed the number specified here, execution proceeds Not Normal Form(NNF) without the condition clause being normalized. Using the NNF method, the condition is not normalized and the index can not be used.

On the other hand, if the value specified here is set to a larger number to avoid the NNF, the process of normalizing the complicated condition clause can use vast amounts of memory, thus the normalizing process itself becomes so expensive

Therefore, it is important to avoid the excessive use of logical operators when writing condition clauses, and to write condition clauses in normal forms.

Similarly, this rule also applies to an ON predicate joined to an ON condition.

3: This method is similar to #1, but the time is measured using the system clock. Therefore, this method doesn't hinder performance as much as the other methods.

If this property is set to 3 on OS platforms other than Linux and PA-RISC-HP-64, it may become impossible to start the Altibase server due to the inability to correctly check the system time. In this case, the Altibase server will leave a warning message in the altibase_boot.log file, reset the TIMER_RUNNING_LEVEL property to its default value, and restart. On platforms for which the default value is 1, the following message is written to the boot log:

[Warning] Because a TIMER_RUNNING_LEVEL of 3 is not supported on this platform,
it has been set to the default(=1) for this platform.

#### TIMER_THREAD_RESOLUTION (Unit: microsecond)

128MB

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[512K, 2<sup>64</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property specifies the maximum size of memory available for allocation for sorting or hashing operations.

The value of this property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running. The response to a request for alteration is immediately returned, however, the altered value is not actually applied to the server until the temporary table in use is nonexistent. For further information about temporary tables, please refer to the description of the TEMP_MAX_PAGE_COUNT property.

#### INIT_TOTAL_WA_SIZE (Unit: bytes)

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

3

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 100]

##### Description

This property specifies the minimum time interval, in seconds, at which to increase the buffer access count. After the value specified in this property has passed since the last time the buffer was accessed, the access count is increased.

### Session Properties

Session-related properties define the rules for communication between clients and the database server when Altibase is run in a client-server configuration. They are as follows:

#### CM_DISCONN_DETECT_TIME (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

3

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

Altibase server provides a session management thread for checking whether the connection between a client and a server has been interrupted. This property specifies the interval, in seconds, at which the session management thread operates. 

Usually, when a client process is abnormally terminated, the server to which the client is connected can immediately detect this.

However, when a session has an unfinished task, and furthermore if the task is an internal Altibase server operation that is not directly related to the client session, and it is taking a long time, the server cannot check whether the client has terminated abnormally. That is to say, because the server cannot check whether the connection with the client has ended abnormally, such abnormal termination would be disregarded and Altibase would continue to process the task.

Such sessions must be detected, and the corresponding transactions must be rolled back. For this purpose, the session management thread regularly checks the status of all sessions.

#### CONCURRENT_EXEC_DEGREE_DEFAULT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

4

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[2, 1024]

##### Description

CONCURRENT_EXEC_DEGREE_DEFAULT specifies for each session, the number of procedures in the DBMS_CONCURRENT_EXEC package that are allowed to execute in parallel concurrently. If the number of procedures to be executed in parallel is omitted, the CONCURRENT_EXEC_DEGREE_DEFAULT value is applied. 

Altibase does not allow a stored package to execute more procedures than the value set for the CONCURRENT_EXEC_DEGREE_MAX property.

The value of this property can be changed with the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running. 

#### CONCURRENT_EXEC_DEGREE_MAX

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

The number of CPUs

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1024]

##### Description

CONCURRENT_EXEC_DEGREE_MAX specifies the maximum number of procedures in the DBMS_CONCURRENT_EXEC package that are allowed to execute in parallel.

If this value is set to 0, the DBMS_CONCURRENT_EXEC package cannot be executed.

The value of this property can be changed with the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running. 

#### CONCURRENT_EXEC_WAIT_INTERVAL

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

100

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[10, 1000000]

##### Description

CONCURRENT_EXEC_WAIT_INTERVAL specifies the interval to wait before checking whether a procedure in the DBMS_CONCURRENT_EXEC package has executed successfully.

The value of this property affects the REQUEST and WAIT_REQ functions. These functions wait for the procedure to finish execution. 

The value of this property can be changed with the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running. 

#### DEFAULT_THREAD_STACK_SIZE (Unit: byte)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default

10485760 (10MB)

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1048576, 134217728]

##### Description

This property specifies the stack size, in bytes, for all system threads other than service threads. 

#### IPC_CHANNEL_COUNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 65535]

##### Description

This property, which specifies the maximum number of IPC communication channels between a client and an Altibase server, must be set. Because shared memory and semaphore(s) are allocated in proportion to the channel count, it is important to set the maximum number of IPC connections that can be simultaneously established with the server.

#### IPC_FILEPATH

##### Data Type

String

##### Default Value

\$ALTIBASE_HOME/trc/cm-ipc

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

None

##### Description

This is a socket file created for Altibase server to connect with the client through IPC in the UNIX environment. 

If the server starts, a socket file is created under $ALTIBASE_HOME/trc/cm-ipc directory, and be careful not to delete this file. 

#### IPCDA_CHANNEL_COUNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 65535]

##### Description

The maximum number of communication channels using IPCDA between the client and server is specified with this property. 

This property specifies the maximum number of IPCDA which can concurrently connect to the server plays an important role since shared memory and semaphores are proportionally allocated to the number of IPCDA channels. The optimized number of IPCDA channels should be half value of the number of CPU cores.

#### IPCDA_DATABLOCK_SIZE (Unit: KB)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

20480

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[32, 102400]

##### Description

This is a property specifying the size of shared memory in a communication channel using IPCDA. If the value is 1000, and IPCDA_CHANNEL_COUNT is 24, the entire memory size (IPCDA_CHANNEL_COUNT * IPCDA_DATABLOCK_SIZE) used for the communication channel in server is 1000KB * 24 = 24000KB. 

The value should be properly specified in order not to interrupt the operation of other programs using shared memory depending on the system size. For example, If IPCDA_CHANNEL_COUNT is 24 in 4GB system memory, the maximum value of IPCDA_DATABLOCK_SIZE cannot be used because the actual memory to use is 2457600KB. 

#### IPCDA_FILEPATH

##### Data Type

String

##### DEfault Value

\$ALTIBASE_HOME/trc/cm-ipcda

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Multiple Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

When a database is created, it cannot be guaranteed that the sequence of characters in the character set specified by NLS_USE is the same as in a dictionary for the language of the country in question.

If this property is set to 1, character comparisons are performed based on the order in which the words in that language appear in a dictionary. If this property is set to 0, character comparisons are performed based on the binary values of the characters.

This is supported only when the database character set is set to Korean (KSC-5601 complete and MS extended complete) because the system currently supports Korean only.

#### NLS_CURRENCY

##### Data Type

String

##### Default Value

Determined by the value of NLS_TERRITORY

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

Character string, maximum10 bytes 

##### Description

This property specifies the currency symbol. The value for this property is used to display the local currency symbol with the L number format. This property value cannot begin with +, -, <, > signs.

While Altibase is running, this property value can be modified with the ALTER SESSION statement as below:

```
ALTER SESSION SET NLS_CURRENCY = '$';
```

> Note: In order to display the Arabic currency symbol properly, the client application program(or shell/editor) must support the display of Arabic characters.

#### NLS_ISO_CURRENCY

##### Data Type

String

##### Default Value

Determined by the value of NLS_TERRITORY.

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

Value that exists in the V$NLS_TERRITORY performance view. 

##### Description

This property specifies the ISO currency symbol. The value of this property is used with the C number format to display the international currency symbol. The value of this property is limited to the value(territory) that exists in the V$NLS_TERRITORY performance view.

##### Description

When NCHAR type data are converted to another character set, data loss can occur. In such cases, this property determines whether to raise an error or to continue converting the data despite the possibility of data loss.

This property raises an error only when data conversion is performed on the server; it doesn’t apply to conversion performed on clients. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SESSION statement while Altibase is running.

0: FALSE (Do not raise an error.)

1: TRUE

#### NLS_NCHAR_LITERAL_REPLACE

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

By default, clients convert an entire query string to the database character set before sending the data to the database. This behavior can be prevented for a given string literal by setting this property to 1 and placing the "N" character in front of the string literal.

A property setting of 1 instructs the client to search for the "N" character in front of every string literal. If the "N" character is found, the client sends the string to the database without converting it to the database character set. This is useful when it is desired to use NCHAR type data that are encoded differently from the database character set.

This property can be changed using the ALTER SESSION statement while Altibase is running.

0: convert all strings to the database character set without checking for the "N" character

1: do not convert strings that are preceded by the "N" character to the database character set

> Note: Setting this property to 1 can be expensive in terms of usage of client resources.

#### NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS

##### Data Type

String

##### Default Value

Determined by the value of NLS_TERRITORY.

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range	

None

##### Description

This property specifies the decimal character and the group separator. The group separator is used to display numbers in thousands and generally uses a comma(,). The decimal character generally uses a period(.).This property value cannot begin with +, -, <, > signs.

Of a character string specified for this property, only the first two characters are set as decimal characters; the group separator and the rest are ignored. 

While Altibase is running, this property value can be modified with the ALTER SESSION statement as below:

```
ALTER SESSION SET NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS='.,';
```

#### NLS_TERRITORY

##### Data Type

String

##### Default Value

KOREA

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

Value that exists in the V$NLS_TERRITORY performance view

##### Description

This property specifies the name of the territory. Values of the NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTER, NLS_CURRENCY, NLS_ISO_CURRENCY properties are automatically modified according to the territory set for this property. Territory names available for specification of this property can be checked by querying the V$NLS_TERRITORY performance view. 

While Altibase is running, this property value can be modified with the ALTER SESSION statement as below. Territory names do not distinguish upper or lower class, and apostrophes(‘) can be used. 

```
ALTER SESSION SET NLS_TERRITORY = America;
or
ALTER SESSION SET NLS_TERRITORY = 'America';
```

#### USE_MEMORY_POOL

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0,1]

##### Description

This property specifies whether memory pooling is used. “Memory pooling” means assigning server memory in advance.

When this function is used, because server memory is allocated in advance, memory use is increased.

0: Do not use memory pooling 

1: Use memory pooling

#### USER_LOCK_POOL_INIT_SIZE (Unit: count)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

128

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[128, 10000]

##### Description

The number of times for user lock in the database can be specified through the USER_LOCK_POOL_INIT_SIZE property. 

By exceeding the property values, the user lock can be used for maximum number of times; however, in that case, performance degradation might be occurred due to overutilization. Moreover, once the user lock is created the user lock cannot be eliminated even though it is released; thus, it can be said that re-using the user unlock that has been once released is rather efficient.

#### USER_LOCK_REQUEST_CHECK_INTERVAL (Unit: microsecond)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

10000

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[10, 999999]

##### Description

The USER_LOCK_REQUEST_CHECK_INTERVAL configures a cycle for examining whether the user lock is available for use or not. If a user, who is currently using in a different session, requests the user lock, the session would be waiting until the user lock is released.

The property value can be modified by using the ALTER SYSTEM statement during the operation of Altibase.

#### USER_LOCK_REQUEST_LIMIT (Unit: count)

#### XA_HEURISTIC_COMPLETE

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2]

##### Description

In a distributed transaction environment, Two-Phase Commit Protocol (XA) is used. While a transaction is underway, after a Prepare command has been received from the global transaction coordinator, if for some reason a COMMIT or ROLLBACK command does not arrive for a long time, Altibase will keep the transaction active for a long time, which will negatively affect database performance.

To prevent this, Altibase terminates the entire transaction if it has been in a PREPARE (or IN_DOUBT) state beyond a certain period of time. In such cases, this property determines whether to use COMMIT or ROLLBACK to terminate the transaction.

Altibase waits for the amount of time specified with the XA_INDOUBT_TX_TIMEOUT property before cancelling a transaction in this way. If the value of XA_HEURISTIC_COMPLETE is 0, which is the default, nothing will be done; if it is 1, the transaction will be committed, and if it is 2, the transaction will be rolled back. 

### Time-out Properties

#### BLOCK_ALL_TX_TIME_OUT (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

3

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property restricts transactions’ access to the hash table when the buffer manager resizes the hash table. The minimum value of 0 specifies that error handling is to be performed without any wait time. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### DDL_LOCK_TIMEOUT (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Short integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[-1, 65535]

##### Description

When DDL query statements are executed, this property sets how long to wait to establish a lock when the target table has already been locked by another transaction. In cases where a transaction cannot immediately gain write access to the table, If this parameter is set to -1, the transaction will wait indefinitely, whereas if this parameter is set to a positive value, the transaction will wait for that number of seconds before trying again.

The default value of this parameter is 0, which tells Altibase to return an error code if it cannot obtain a lock immediately at the time of executing a DDL statement. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### DDL_TIMEOUT (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

If the execution time of a DDL statement exceeds the number of seconds specified here, execution of that statement is canceled. The default value of this property is 0, in which case Altibase waits indefinitely for DDL operations to finish. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM or ALTER SESSION statement while Altibase is running.

> Note: In Altibase versions up to 5.5.1, the execution time of DDL statements was governed by the UTRANS_TIMEOUT and QUERY_TIMEOUT properties, which still govern the execution time of DML and DCL statements.

#### FETCH_TIMEOUT (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

60

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property prevents abnormal increases in database memory consumption when SELECT statements executed by client applications take an excessive amount of time. In cases where the query execution time exceeds the number of seconds specified using this property, the session will be disconnected and the transaction will be rolled back. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM or ALTER SESSION statement while Altibase is running.

#### IDLE_TIMEOUT (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

If a large number of clients are connected to a server for an excessive period of time due to some abnormality, the number of available connections will significantly decrease, ultimately leading to failure to provide service.

This property functions to preemptively prevent this situation. If the number of seconds that a session is idle exceeds this value, the session will be disconnected and any associated transactions will be rolled back. 

The value of this property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM or ALTER SESSION statement while Altibase is running.

#### LOGIN_TIMEOUT (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property is set to prevent abnormal increases in database memory consumption when particular kinds of queries (especially those involving sort operations or joins) are executed. If the query execution time exceeds the number of seconds specified here, the transaction is partially rolled back. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM or ALTER SESSION statement while Altibase is running.

#### SHUTDOWN_IMMEDIATE_TIMEOUT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

60

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

When shutting down Altibase with the IMMEDIATE option, Altibase is shut down after uncommitted transactions are rolled back. This property specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the transactions to be rolled back. If the elapsed time exceeds the specified value, Altibase is shut down forcibly and uncommitted transactions are not rolled back. If this property is set to 0, Altibase waits until all transactions are rolled back. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### UTRANS_TIMEOUT (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default value

3600

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

### Tranaction Properties

#### AUTO_COMMIT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property determines whether to handle each individual SQL statement as a separate transaction and commit it when SQL statements are executed in a session. A value of 1 indicates auto-commit mode, while a value of 0 indicates non-autocommit mode. When using non-autocommit mode, the client application must explicitly indicate the beginning and end of a transaction. 

Even if this value is set to 1, indicating auto-commit, when the server is started, this property can be changed for individual sessions. For example, if ALTER SESSION SET AUTOCOMMIT = FALSE (non-autocommit) is executed from a client, the user must explicitly specify whether to commit or rollback any transactions that occur for the remainder of the session. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### ISOLATION_LEVEL

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 3]

##### Description 

This property specifies the transaction isolation level. When a single transaction searches the same table multiple times, the result varies depending on the isolation level. 

For more information about transaction isolation levels, please refer to the *Altibase Administrator’s Manual*.

| Isolation Level     | Characteristics                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0 (Committed Read)  | This is the default mode of Altibase. This isolation level guarantees that previously read data that have been modified by another transaction will reflect the changes of that other transaction. When a SELECT transaction reads data one time and then reads the data again, if another transaction simultaneously executes and commits an INSERT or DELETE statement, due to this change, it is possible for a new row to be found, or for a previously found row to have disappeared. |
| 1 (Repeatable Read) | This isolation level guarantees that the contents of a row will be the same upon repeated reads by the same transaction.This isolation level places a lock on a row once it has been read. Therefore, when the table is subsequently read, previously read rows will not change or disappear, but it is possible for new rows to appear. |
| 2 (No Phantom)      | This isolation level guarantees identical results for repeated reads. |

#### TRANSACTION_TABLE_SIZE (Unit: Transaction count)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1024

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[16,16384]

##### Description

The number of transactions which can be simultaneously created during the Altibase service is specifiable when creating a database, and memory for such process is allocated in advance. 

This property should increase or decrease the value by 2n and the database must be created again when decreasing the value.

### Backup and Recovery Properties

These properties are related to the management of change logs, which are maintained in response to database changes.

#### ARCHIVE_DIR

##### Data Type

String

##### Default Value

\$ALTIBASE_HOME/arch_logs

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Multiple Values

##### Range

None

##### Description

This property specifies the directory or directories in which to store archive log files when performing an archive log backup. If this value is not expressly specified by the user, the default location is $ALTIBASE_HOME/arch_logs. 

The number of directories specified in this property must be the same as the number specified in the LOG_DIR property. 

The user can explicitly specify the value(s), but the specified directories must be created first. If not, an error message will be output, and Altibase will not start.

#### ARCHIVE_FULL_ACTION

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property controls the action of the archivelog thread, which conducts archive log backup, when there is not enough disk space in the archive log destination (specified using ARCHIVE_DIR).

If this parameter is set to 0, the archivelog thread will output an error message and stop the archive log file backup. Even if enough disk space can subsequently be secured, archive log backup will not resume until the user explicitly issues a command to do so. If checkpointing takes place in such cases, unnecessary log files will be deleted, even if no archive log file backup has been conducted. Therefore care must be taken when using this mode.

If this parameter is set to 1, the archivelog thread waits until enough disk space can be secured to perform the archive log file backup. Because the archive log files have not been backed up, care must be taken to prevent the log files from being deleted if checkpointing takes place during this waiting period.

#### ARCHIVE_MULTIPLEX_COUNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 10]

##### Description 

This property specifies how many copies of the archive log file<sup>9</sup> are to be kept by the Altibase server. After this property has been specified, copies of newly archived log files are kept.

[<sup>9</sup>] Multiplexing archive log files

This feature copies the archive log files to a separate disk to prepare for the event of damage to the original archive log files.

The ARCHIVE_MULTIPLEX_COUNT and ARCHIVE_MULTIPLEX_DIR properties can be specified while the server is shutdown.

#### ARCHIVE_MULTIPLEX_DIR

##### Data Type

String

##### Default Value

""

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Multiple Value

##### Range

None

##### Description

This property specifies the path for copies of the archive log file. The number of values specified in the ARCHIVE_MULTIPLEX_DIR properties must be equal to the value specified in the ARCHIVE_MULTIPLEX_COUNT property. It is recommended to set each path to a separate disk.

#### ARCHIVE_THREAD_AUTOSTART

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property specifies whether to activate the archivelog thread, which periodically performs archive log file backups. If this property is 1, the archivelog thread is activated.

After the archivelog thread has been suspended due to insufficient disk space in the backup directory, this property is used to restart the thread automatically after sufficient disk space is secured.

#### CHECKPOINT_ENABLED

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property specifies whether checkpointing is enabled (“ON”) or disabled (“OFF”).

0: OFF

1: ON

When this value is 0 (“OFF”), the checkpoint thread cannot be started, and additionally it cannot operate the checkpoint interval specified by CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL_IN_SEC and CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL_IN_LOG. However, the user can perform checkpointing manually.

#### CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL_IN_LOG

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

100

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property defines the checkpoint interval based on the log file creation count. In other words, after the log files have been replaced the number of times specified using this property, checkpointing will be automatically executed. When checkpointing is requested based on this property, it may be impossible to execute, either because checkpointing is already underway, or for some other reason.

In such cases, checkpointing is not initiated immediately again after the checkpointing that is already underway has finished; instead, the current checkpointing request is canceled. Therefore, the next checkpointing request will occur when the number of log files reaches the value set in this property. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL_IN_SEC (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

6000

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[3, 2592000]

##### Description

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### COMMIT_WRITE_WAIT_MODE 

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property specifies whether to wait until logs have been written to log files when committing transactions. In Altibase, the default is not to wait, in the interests of better performance.

This property can be set for the entire system or for individual user sessions, and thus this property can be changed using either the ALTER SYSTEM or ALTER SESSION statement while Altibase is running.

0: Do Not Wait

1: Wait

#### INCREMENTAL_BACKUP_CHUNK_SIZE

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

4

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Multiple Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property is specified to track the changes made to pages of data(unit: pages). For example, if the value of this property is set to 4, change tracking information is recorded for every 4 pages and all of the 4 pages are backed up if one of the 4 pages is changed.

To alter the value of this property, the changeTracking file must be recreated in the following steps:

1. Shut down the server and then alter the value in the properties file.
2. Start up the server.
3. Disable change tracking and then reactivate it.

#### INCREMENTAL_BACKUP_INFO_RETENTION_PERIOD

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property specifies the period of time(unit: days) during which backup information stored in the backupInfo file is retained

Backup information deleted with the ALTER DATABASE DELETE OBSOLETE BACKUP FILES statement ranges from the oldest expired level 0 backup to the level 1 backup immediately prior to the oldest unexpired level 0 backup.

> Note: Backup files backed up at level 0 are a prerequisite for incremental backups. Regardless of the existence of backup information which has expired the maintenance period specified for this property and the corresponding backup files, if only a level 0 backup has been performed, expired backup information and backup files are not deleted, even if the “ALTER DATABASE DELETE OBSOLETE ...” statement is executed.

#### LOG_BUFFER_TYPE 

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property determines the log buffer type. If it is set to 0, the OS kernel log buffer is used. If it is set to 1, the process memory log buffer is used.

This property cannot be changed while the system is running.

#### LOG_MULTIPLEX_COUNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 10]

##### Description

This property specifies how many copies of the log file<sup>10</sup> are to be kept by the Altibase server. Whenever original log files are created or dropped, the copies of log files are also simultaneously created or dropped. 

[<sup>10</sup>] Multiplexing Log Files

This feature copies the log files to which all changes of the database have been written, to a separate disk to prepare for the event of damage to the original log files.

The LOG_MULTIPLEX_COUNT and LOG_MULTIPLEX_DIR properties can be specified while the server is shutdown.

#### LOG_MULTIPLEX_DIR

##### Data Type

String

##### Default Value

""

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

None

##### Description

This property specifies the path for copies of the log file. The number of values specified in the LOG_MULTIPLEX_DIR properties must be equal to the value of the LOG_MULTIPLEX_COUNT property. It is recommended to set each path to a separate disk.

#### PREPARE_LOG_FILE_COUNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

5

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

If there is not enough space in the log file when logs are written, a new log file is created, which can increase the transaction response time. To prevent such delays in transaction execution caused by the creation of log files, Altibase creates extra log files (“prepare log files”) in advance. This parameter specifies the number of such log files.

**SNAPSHOT_MEM_THRESHOLD (Unit: percentage)**

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

80

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 100]

##### Description

This is a property which sets up available thresholds for use in memory database after the snapshot settings (BEGIN SNAPSHOT). 

The percentage of the MEM_MAX_DB_SIZE property which is currently being used by memory is verified, and if it exceeds the specified threshold, the snapshot is automatically stopped.

**SNAPSHOT_DISK_UNDO_THRESHOLD (Unit: percentage)**

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

80

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 100]

##### Description

This property specifies thresholds usable in disk after the snapshot settings (BEGING SNAPSHOT).

It verifies what percentage of the SYS_UNDO_FILE_MAX_SIZE property has been used by the disk undo tablespace up to now, and if it exceeds specified threshold, the snapshot is automatically stopped.

### Replication Properties

The following parameters pertain to database replication. For more information about database replication, please refer to the *Getting Started Guide* and to the R*eplication User's Manual.*

#### REPLICATION_ACK_XLOG_COUNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

100

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property indicates the frequency with which the Receiver thread sends ACK to the Sender thread.

The Receiver thread receives XLogs and replays them one by one. When the number of replayed XLogs exceeds the value specified here, the Receiver thread sends ACK to the Sender thread.

If this value is set too low, the Receiver thread sends ACK too often, leading to reduced performance.

If it is set too high, the amount of time that the Sender thread waits for ACK can increase excessively, and may be treated as a network fault. In addition, if the Sender thread does not receive ACK for an extended time, the replication restart SN is not updated, and thus the Sender thread will start over from the most recent log record if checkpointing occurs, resulting in the deletion of unreplicated logs.

#### REPLICATION_ALLOW_DUPLICATE_HOSTS 

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

This property specifies whether or not to allow replication objects to set duplicate values for the IP address and port number of the remote server.

0: Disallowed

1: Allowed

#### REPLICATION_BEFORE_IMAGE_LOG_ENABLE

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

If the "before image" of the replication Receiver differs from the "before image" of the XLog received from the Sender, it is possible for data conflict to occur.

With this property, the "before image" of the replication receiver can be stored in the trace log to enable the user to check which data conflicted. 

0: Disables trace logging

1: Enables trace logging

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_COMMIT_WRITE_WAIT_MODE

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property determines whether the replication Receiver checks whether XLOGs have been applied to disk after the replication Receiver has completed executing all of the transactions that are necessary in order to apply the contents of XLOGs to disk. If this property is set to 0, the replication Receiver doesn't wait to ensure that the contents of XLOGs have been applied to disk. If the value of this property is set to 1, the replication Receiver ensures that the contents of XLOGs have been applied to disk.

#### REPLICATION_CONNECT_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

60

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property specifies whether to allow DDL statements to be executed on replication target tables. If this property is set to 1, DDL statements can be executed on replication target tables.

Before executing DDL statements, if the replication property of a transaction in the current session is set to a value other than NONE, the Sender thread can be made aware of the execution of DDL statements.

For a list of DDL statements permitted during replication and other restrictions, please refer to the *Replication Manual*.

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_DDL_ENABLE_LEVEL

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name ON table_name ( column_name );

CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name ( expression );

DROP INDEX index_name; ( unique, function-base indexes can be deleted. )

#### REPLICATION_DDL_SYNC

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property indicates whether DDL is replicated during replication.

0 : Do not allow DDL replication during replication. When executing DDL, it is executed only in the replicaiton local server.

1 : Allow DDL replication during replication. When executing DDL, DDL is replicated to the replicaiton remote server.

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM or ALTER SESSION statement while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_DDL_SYNC_TIMEOUT (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

7200

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM or ALTER SESSION statemenet while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_EAGER_PARALLEL_FACTOR

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

The smaller value among 'number of CPUs/2' and '512'

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 512]

##### Description

When replication is executed on EAGER mode, multiple Sender threads are operated in parallel. This property specifies the number of Sender threads to be operated in parallel; an increase in the number of Sender threads leads to an improvement in replication performance. 

When increasing the number of Sender threads with this property, however, the user must note that the order in which the Sender threads send transactions are not guaranteed. For further information about this matter, please refer to the *Replication Manual*.

If this property is not set, the default value is the smaller value among the number of CPUs/2 and 512.

#### REPLICATION_EAGER_RECEIVER_MAX_ERROR_COUNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

5

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

When replication is performed in eager mode, this property can set the number of times the replication Receiver is to attempt data replication.

If this value is set to 5 and an Xlog replication error occurs, the replication Receiver attempts replication up to 5 times, and forcefully terminates the Altibase server if the last attempt fails.

When this value is set to 0, if an Xlog replication error occurs, the replication Receiver attempts replication until it succeeds and does not forcefully terminate the server. 

Replication in eager mode is mainly used in environments where data concurrency between the replication Receiver and the Sender are important. Therefore, data replication is stopped and the server is terminated to prevent data conflicts.

 The value of this property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_FAILBACK_INCREMENTAL_SYNC

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property sets the execution of incremental sync on or off. If one of the servers during replication in EAGER mode fails and data inconsistency occurs, Incremental Sync performs data synchronization on the inconsistent data upon restart of the failure server. 

- 0: Deactivates Incremental Sync
- 1: Activates Incremental Sync

The value of this property for both Altibase servers participating in replication must be identical. For more detailed information about incremental synchronization and EAGER replication failure recovery, refer to *Replication Manual.*

#### REPLICATION_GAP_UNIT (Unit: byte)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Long

##### Default Value

1048576 (1MB)

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 2<sup>64</sup>-1]

##### Description 

This property sets the unit that represents the value of REP_GAP for querying the size of the replication gap.

The value of REP_GAP is the result of dividing the value of REP_GAP_SIZE by this property, and rounding up the rest.

By default, REP_GAP_SIZE of V$REPGAP is retrieved in bytes, and REP_GAP is retrieved in megabytes (MB).



#### REPLICATION_GAPLESS_ALLOW_TIME (Unit: microsecond)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

2000

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

If the GAPLESS option is enabled, the replication sender allows a replication gap for as long as the value (unit: microseconds) set for the REPLICATION_GAPLESS_ALLOW_TIME property. The replication sender delays transaction commits if it anticipates the replication gap to still exist after the amount of time set for this property. 

For example, if the REPLICATION_GAPLESS_ALLOW_TIME property is set to 5 and the sender sends 1,000 XLogs per second, a replication gap of 5,000 XLogs is allowed. If the current replication gap consists of 10,000 XLogs, this means that transaction commits must be delayed for five microseconds, since 5,000 XLogs have exceeded the limit. 

If the REPLICATION_GAPLESS_ALLOW_TIME property is set to 0, this means that no replication gaps are allowed; transactions will be committed only after replication gaps are dissolved.

The value of this property can be altered using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running. 

#### REPLICATION_GAPLESS_MAX_WAIT_TIME (Unit: microsecond)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

10*,*000*,*000

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

When the GAPLESS option is enabled, the REPLICATION_GAPLESS_MAX_WAIT_TIME property sets the maximum amount of time (unit: microseconds) that the replication sender can delay transaction commits to dissolve replication gaps. 

If the REPLICATION_GAPLESS_MAX_WAIT_TIME property is set to 0, transactions will be committed only after replication gaps are dissolved.

The value of this property can be altered using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running. 

#### REPLICATION_GROUPING_TRANSACTION_MAX_COUNT (Unit: count)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

5

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 1000]

##### Description

The REPLICATION_GROUPING_TRANSACTION_MAX_COUNT property sets the maximum number of transactions that are allowed to be accumulated into a single transaction group. 

The value of this property can be altered using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running. 

#### REPLICATION_GROUPING_AHEAD_READ_NEXT_LOG_FILE (Unit: count)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

2

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

The REPLICATION_GROUPING_AHEAD_READ_NEXT_LOG_FILE property sets the value to be incremented to the current file being read by the sender; the Ahead Analyzer will start analyzing an XLog that increments (starting from the value of the current file) by as much as this value. 

The value of this property can be altered using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running. 

#### REPLICATION_HBT_DETECT_HIGHWATER_MARK

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

5

##### Attribute

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property specifies the number of failed connection attempts to make before determining that a failure has occurred in a replication environment. Thus, the maximum time that can pass before it is determined that a host has failed can be calculated by multiplying REPLICATION_HBT_DETECT_TIME * REPLICATION_HBT_DETECT_HIGHWATER_MARK.

In other words, if the HeartBeat thread (see below) fails to connect for 30 seconds (i.e. 5 attempts * 6 seconds, the default values for each of the above properties), it will be handled as a failure.

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_HBT_DETECT_TIME (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

6

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2592000]

##### Description

This property specifies the interval, in seconds, at which to check the HeartBeat thread<sup>12</sup>. The HeartBeat thread checks the host for a fault every 6 seconds (the default value). This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

[<sup>12</sup>] HeartBeat thread

In an Altibase replication environment, in order to allow physical faults to be detected as quickly as possible while data are being exchanged between a Sender thread and a Receiver thread, a HeartBeat Thread is used to allow each host to regularly check the condition of the other host.

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_IB_LATENCY

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 65535]

##### Description

When connecting with replication, this property displays the connection port number of the local server when connecting using the InfiniBand.

To use the InfiniBand, the value of the IB_ENABLE property must be 1. If this value is 0, replication cannot be connected with the InfiniBand.

#### REPLICATION_INSERT_REPLACE

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property specifies whether to keep inserted contents if an insert conflict occurs during replication. If this value has been set to 0, the insert will not be committed, and the data conflict will be handled as an error, whereas if this value has been set to 1, the data conflict will be ignored and the insert will be committed. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_KEEP_ALIVE_CNT 

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

600

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

A KEEP_ALIVE signal is sent when a Sender thread has not sent a packet and has slept for REPLICATION_SENDER_SLEEP_TIME * REPLICATION_KEEP_ALIVE_CNT.

#### REPLICATION_LOCK_TIMEOUT (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

5

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Description

[0, 3600]

##### Description

When a replication deadlock occurs, the Receiver thread will wait indefinitely to establish a lock, which may result in a service interruption. To prevent this, when the Receiver thread requests a lock to perform this kind of operation, it will only wait for the number of seconds specified using this property.

If a lock cannot be acquired within the given time, the corresponding operation will be rolled back.

#### REPLICATION_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE (단위 : MB)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>12</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property is set in order to improve replication performance using a dedicated replication log buffer. The dedicated replication log buffer filters and stores only replication logs. The Sender thread can read logs from the log buffer or from disk. However, when reading logs from disk, the processing speed of the Sender thread may be greatly reduced. Furthermore, the additional burden of reading unnecessary logs is imposed. The dedicated replication log buffer mitigates this burden. 

When multiple replication Sender threads are working, replication and overall service performance can suffer. This is because there is only one replication log buffer, so if it is accessed by more than one Sender thread, synchronization overhead is more likely to occur. When the REPLICATION_SYNC_LOG value is set to 1, this property must be set to 0. Otherwise, the Altibase server will fail to start. If the value of this property is set too small, it may lead to worse performance than when it is not used at all (i.e. when it is set to 0).

#### REPLICATION_MAX_COUNT (Unit: count)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

32

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 10240]

##### Description

This property specifies the maximum number of replication objects which can be created in Altibase. 

The default value is 32, which means that one server can connect to a maximum number of 32 remote servers by replication.

#### REPLICATION_MAX_LISTEN

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

32

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 512]

##### Description

This property specifies the maximum size of the “listen queue” when TCP/IP is used for communication between a Sender thread and an Altibase server that maintains a Receiver thread.

#### REPLICATION_MAX_LOGFILE

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 65535]

##### Description

This property specifies the maximum number of log files preceding the Restart Redo Point that are to be prevented from being deleted, for use in replication. If, after replication starts, changes to a local server are not also made on a remote server for some reason, such as reduced network speed between the local and remote servers, replication will prevent log files from being deleted, even after checkpointing has taken place. Under such circumstances, the number of log files on the local server will continue to increase, which can ultimately lead to a disk full error. 

Therefore, when checkpointing occurs, if the number of accumulated log files preceding the Restart Redo Point exceeds the number specified using this property, replication is temporarily suspended, and the time and XSN at which replication was suspended are stored in the GIVE_UP_TIME and GIVE_UP_XSN columns in the SYS_REPLICATIONS_ meta table. Additionally, all of the log files preceding the Restart Redo Point are deleted. The replication restart SN is set to the highest SN in the current log file, and this value is stored in the XSN column in the SYS_REPLICATIONS_ meta table. Replication will be performed starting from this new restart SN. If it is desired to change this default behavior, change the value of the REPLICATION_SENDER_START_AFTER_GIVING_UP property. Additionally, in order to reinitialize all of the information pertaining to a particular replication object in the SYS_REPLICATIONS_ meta table, execute “ALTER REPLICATION replication_name RESET”. 

If the REPLICATION_MAX_LOGFILE property is set to 0, or if replication is running in EAGER mode, this function is disabled. Please note that because log files are erased when checkpointing is carried out, the values of the CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL_IN_SEC and CHECKPOINT_IN_LOG properties should be considered when setting the value of this property.

#### REPLICATION_POOL_ELEMENT_COUNT (Unit: count)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

10

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 1024]

##### Description

This is the amount of memory (number of elements) used when a Sender thread analyzes a log and copies column values. Memory elements are pre-allocated from the memory pool, and their size is specified by REPLICATION_POOL_ELEMENT_SIZE. 

The value of this property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_POOL_ELEMENT_SIZE (Unit : Byte)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default value

256

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[128, 65536]

##### Description

This is the size of a memory element, in bytes, that is used when the sender thread analyzes a log and copies column values. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running. 

#### REPLICATION_PORT_NO

#### REPLICATION_PREFETCH_LOGFILE_COUNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

3

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1024]

##### Description

This property specifies the number of prefetch log files, that is, the number of log files in each log file group that are read in advance. Pre-reading and caching log files allows the Sender thread to read logs from log files more quickly.

#### REPLICATION_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

7200

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property, which is used by both the Sender thread and the Receiver thread, specifies the maximum amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a message from the Receiver or Sender thread, respectively.

In the case where the Sender thread has waited for a response from the Receiver thread for the maximum amount of time specified here, the Sender thread will enter into sleep mode for the amount of time specified using the REPLICATION_SENDER_SLEEP_TIMEOUT property before again attempting to connect to the Receiver thread. In this case, the existing socket is closed and a new socket is created for the new connection attempt.

This property also specifies the maximum time that the Receiver thread waits for a message from a Sender thread. If the specified amount of time has passed, the Receiver thread is automatically terminated, and a new Receiver thread will be created when the Sender thread sends a message. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_RECEIVER_APPLIER_ASSIGN_MODE

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

REPLICATION_RECEIVER_APPLIER_ASSIGN_MODE

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

The REPLICATION_RECEIVER_APPLIER_ASSIGN_MODE property sets the mode in which the replication sender is to assign XLogs to the applier. 

0: XLog Count Mode

1: Transaction Count Mode

If the REPLICATION_RECEIVER_APPLIER_ASSIGN_MODE property is set to 0, XLogs are assigned to the applier with the least amount of XLogs. 

If the REPLICATION_RECEIVER_APPLIER_ASSIGN_MODE property is set to 1, XLogs are assigned to the applier with the least number of transactions. 

The value of this property can be altered using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running. 

#### REPLICATION_RECEIVER_APPLIER_QUEUE_SIZE

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

20

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[2, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

The REPLICATION_RECEIVER_APPLIER_QUEUE_SIZE sets the maximum number of XLogs that the sender is allowed to be passed to the queue for applier threads. 

Although a large value for the REPLICATION_RECEIVER_APPLIER_QUEUE_SIZE property means that a large number of XLogs will be passed to the applier, memory usage increases because XLogs are queued. The user is recommended to set the REPLICATION_RECEIVER_APPLIER_QUEUE_SIZE property to twice as much as the number of appliers. 

The value of this property can be altered using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running. 

#### REPLICATION_RECOVERY_MAX_LOGFILE

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>–1]

##### Description

This property specifies the maximum number of log files that are not deleted, based on a Restart Redo Point, for data recovery using replication. 

In order to recover data at the time of replication, the local server does not delete logs that have not been flushed to disk on remote servers. Even if checkpointing takes place at this time, because the log files cannot be deleted, the number of log files on the local server will continue to increase and this can ultimately lead to a disk full error. 

Thus, if the maximum log file count in the recovery options is exceeded when checkpointing occurs, replication-based recovery is aborted and the log files are deleted. Then, replication starts over. 

If this property is set to 0 or replication runs in eager mode, this function is not used. Because log files are deleted when checkpointing occurs, the values of CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL_IN_SEC and CHECKPOINT_IN_LOG should be considered together.

#### REPLICATION_RECOVERY_MAX_TIME (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

2<sup>32</sup>–1

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>–1]

##### Description

If the number of seconds specified using this property is exceeded while the replication module is performing recovery, recovery is stopped and service is provided in the state in which recovery has been performed up to that point. 

If this property is set to 0, replication-based recovery is not performed. 

Before replication-based data recovery is completed, Altibase will not be able to proceed to the service stage, and service may be delayed.

#### REPLICATION_SENDER_AUTO_START

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

If a replication object which has not been stopped at the termination of the previous Altibase server exists, this replication object is automatically started by default when the server restarts. 

If this value is set to 0, a replication object can be prevented from automatically starting.

#### REPLICATION_SENDER_COMPRESS_XLOG

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

#### REPLICATION_SENDER_SEND_TIMEOUT (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

7200

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property specifies the maximum amount of time that the sending thread will wait when sending a packet to a remote server.

It is recommended that this value be the same as the value of the REPLICATION_RECEIVER_TIMEOUT (default 7200 seconds) property. If the value is set to 0, the sender thread uses a blocking socket.

The value of this property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_SENDER_SLEEP_TIME (Unit: microsecond)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

10000

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property indicates the sleep time, in microseconds, when there are no more logs to be read by the Sender thread. Because certain platforms ignore short Sleep time values, a suitable value must be specified. The value specified here is used in conjunction with REPLICATION_KEEP_ALIVE_CNT to determine when to send KEEP_ALIVE.

#### REPLICATION_SENDER_SLEEP_TIMEOUT (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

60

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2592000]

##### Description

This property specifies the number of microseconds that a replication Sender thread that is in an error state must sleep before trying again. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_SENDER_START_AFTER_GIVING_UP

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property determines how replication proceeds after replication has been suspended due to the number of accumulated log files preceding the Restart Redo Point exceeding the value of the REPLICATION_MAX_LOGFILE property.

If this value is set to 0, the replication restart SN (which is stored in the XSN column in the SYS_REPLICATIONS_ meta table) is reinitialized (set to -1), and replication is suspended. Additionally, the value of the IS_STARTED column in the SYS_REPLICATIONS_ meta table is set to 0.

If this value is set to 1, the replication restart SN is set to the last generated sequence number in the current log file, and replication is performed starting from this new restart SN.

#### REPLICATION_SERVER_FAILBACK_MAX_TIME

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

2<sup>32</sup>-1

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

In EAGER mode replication, when a server that was terminated abnormally is restarted, it resumes providing service only after it has synchronized its data with the data on another (i.e. the remote) server. At this time, if the process of applying the logs from the other server on the server that experienced the fault takes longer than the number of seconds specified using this property, the server that experienced the fault gives up waiting for synchronization to complete.

#### REPLICATION_SQL_APPLY_ENABLE

##### Data Type

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

Please refer to *Administrator’s Manual* for in-depth description on Direct-Path Insert. 

The value of this property can be modified through ALTER SYSTEM statement during the Altibase operation.

#### REPLICATION_SYNC_LOCK_TIMEOUT (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

30

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

When replication synchronization is performed, the Replication Sender Thread determines the current position in the log at which replication will start after synchronization. In order to prevent another transaction from changing the data in the table on which synchronization is to be performed right at the time of this determination, the Replication Sender Thread obtains an S Lock on the table on which synchronization is to be performed for a short time before synchronization. This property specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait to establish a lock when a table to be synchronized has been locked by another transaction. If a lock is requested but cannot be obtained immediately, the replication process will wait for the amount of time specified here. If a lock cannot be obtained within the amount of time specified here, the synchronization attempt will be handled as an error. If this value is specified as 0, a lock is not established on the replication target table; however, data conflict can occur.

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_SYNC_LOG

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

When performing replication, because the Sender thread sends logs that are in memory regardless of whether they have been committed to disk, data inconsistency or other problems may occur in the event of system or media failure.

To prevent this problem, setting this value to 1 ensures that the Sender thread only sends logs that have already been committed to disk.

#### REPLICATION_SYNC_TUPLE_COUNT

##### Data Type

##### Default Value

50000

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>64</sup>-1]

#### REPLICATION_TIMESTAMP_RESOLUTION

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value 값

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

In an Active-Active replication environment, if this property is set to 1 and a TIMESTAMP column exists in a given replication target table, then the TIMESTAMP-based resolution scheme is used to resolve any data conflicts that occur in that table. 

However, even if a TIMESTAMP column exists in a replication target table, if this value has been set to 0, some other conflict resolution scheme is used. 

For more detailed information about TIMESTAMP-based resolution and data conflicts, please refer to the *Altibase Replication Manual*. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_TRANSACTION_POOL_SIZE

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

Replication receivers use transactions when copying data and create respective transaction pools - wherein transactions can be created in advance for use - for performance improvement. This property specifies the number of transactions that are to be created in advance in transaction pools.

If the number of transactions existing in pools falls short, the replication receiver will create new transactions and use them. The transactions thus created are returned to pools after use; if the number of transactions existing at that time is larger than the value specified in this property, the transactions are immediately freed, instead of being returned. 

If set to an excessively large value, it can constrain the number of normal transactions; therefore, an appropriate number of transactions must be specified. This property permits the maximum value of 232 -1; however, the actual maximum value is identical to the value specified in the property of TRANSACTION_TABLE_SIZE. If the user specifies this value to be larger than the value of TRANSACTION_TABLE_SIZE, the value of this property will be internally set as the value of the TRANSACTION_TABLE_SIZE. 

This property value can be changed while Altibase is running; however, transaction pools are initialized at the creation of replication receiver threads and replication must be restarted for the modified property values to be applied. 

This property value can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### REPLICATION_UPDATE_REPLACE

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

### C/C++ External Procedure Agent Properties

#### EXTPROC_AGENT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

60 Seconds

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[5, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property specifies the maximum length of time in seconds during which Altibase attempts to connect to the external procedure agent when the user calls an external procedure. If the connection does not succeed within the time specified in this property, the call is terminated with the error message displaying that the external procedure call failed. Once a connection is made, external procedure calls are not affected by the value of this property.

#### EXTPROC_AGENT_CALL_RETRY_COUNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 10]

##### Description

When the user calls an external procedure, EXTPROC_AGENT_CALL_RETRY_COUNT specifies the number of times Altibase tries to reconnect to the external procedure agent. 

Altibase first needs to check whether the external procedure agent exists. The external procedure agent may have been timed out and terminated due to the value specified for the EXTPROC_AGENT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT property. In this case, EXTPROC_AGENT_CALL_RETRY_COUNT specifies the number of times Altibase tries to reconnect to the external procedure agent. 

The value of this property can be altered with the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### EXTPROC_AGENT_IDLE_TIMEOUT

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Multiple Value

##### Range

[5, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property specifies the maximum length of time, in seconds, in which the external procedure agent process is to stand by in an idle state. If an external procedure call is made when the external procedure agent process is standing by in an idle state, response time is optimized, as the procedure is executed without connecting to the agent process. However, standby of the agent process in the absence of an external procedure call is a waste of resources; the extension of standby time is recommended only when external procedure calls are highly frequent.

#### EXTPROC_AGENT_SOCKET_FILEPATH

##### Data Type

String

##### Default Value

\$ALTIBASE_HOME/trc

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

None

##### Description

This is a socket file's path created for Altibase server to connect with the external procedure agent. If the external procedure uses, the session creates a socket file with socket_sessionID when creating an external procedure agent. The socket file is automatically deleted when the session is colsed normally. And, be careful not to delete this file.

##### Range

- operation ::= [PERMIT\|DENY]  
  Indicates whether to allow or deny access by an IP packet that matches a validation rule.
  
- address  
  Indicates the IP address of the packet to validate. It can be in IPv4 or IPv6 address notation.
  
- mask  
  If the specified address is in IPv4 address notation, mask specifies that only part of the IP address of a packet, the subnet mask, is to be validated. 
  
  If the specified address is in IPv6 address notation, mask gives the length of prefix bits to be compared. An IPv6 address is matched if the specified mask bits of the specified address are equal to the specified mask bits of the originating address of an incoming IP packet.

##### Validation Rule

THEN  valid
ELSE  invalid
```

##### Description

This property can grant or deny an IP packet attempting to access to Altibase in accordance with an address. By inspecting the IP packet address based upon the specified inspection rules, it can be decided whether or not to allow access. If the IP packet address is corresponding as described in the operation, the access is permitted, but if not, the IP packet is neglected and the next list will be inspected. 

If multiple IP packet addresses are specified, the inspection is executed in the order delineated. If there is no address to be matched, the access is allowed. 

If the property value of ACCESS_LIST_FILE is described, an external file list defined in the ACCESS_LIST property can be used. The external file can use maximum 1024 lists, but 'ACCESS_LIST=' should be omitted and only the contents should be written out.
