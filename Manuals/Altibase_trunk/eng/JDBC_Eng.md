## 1. Starting JDBC

This chapter describes the basic method of using Altibase's JDBC driver.

### Installing the JDBC Driver

Download and install the Altibase package from the Altibase homepage (www.altibase.com). 

Once the package is installed, the Altibase JDBC driver can be found in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/lib directory.

#### Version Compatibility

The Altibase 7.1 JDBC driver is a Type 4 pure Java JDBC driver, which conforms to the JDBC 3.0 specification and operates normally on JDK 1.5. or higher.

#### Checking the JDBC Driver Version

The versions of the installed JDBC driver and the JDK with which the driver has been compiled can be checked as below:

```
$ java -jar $ALTIBASE_HOME/lib/Altibase.jar
JDBC Driver Info : Altibase 7.1.0.0.0 with CMP 7.1.3 for JDBC 3.0 compiled with JDK 5
```



#### Setting the CLASSPATH

To use Altibase JDBC, the Altibase JDBC driver must be added to the CLASSPATH environment variable.

Altibase provides both Altibase.jar file supporting logging function and Altibase_t.jar file which does not support the logging function. 

ex) When using the bash shell in the Unix environment:

```
$ export CLASSPATH=$ALTIBASE_HOME/lib/Altibase.jar:.:$CLASSPATH
```

#### Setting the LB_LIBRARY_PATH

When using the auto-tuning function of asynchronous prefetch, a JNI module is required and the directory where the libaltijext.so file is located must be added to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. Even if the JNI module fails to load, functionality other than auto-tuning will still work.

ex) When using the bash shell in the Unix environment:

```
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ALTIBASE_HOME/lib:.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```



### Connecting to the Database

This section describes the basic method of connecting to Altibase server by JDBC in program code.

#### Loading the Driver

How to load the Driver class of the Altibase JDBC driver and locate the driver are shown below:

1. Register the Altibase JDBC driver with the DriverManager.

   ```
   Class.forName(“Altibase.jdbc.driver.AltibaseDriver”);
   ```

2. Acquire the driver from the DriverManager with the connection URL.

   ```
   String sURL = "jdbc:Altibase://localhost:20300/mydb";
   Driver sDriver = DriverManager.getDriver( sURL );
   ```


#### Configuring Connection Information

Multiple connection information can be passed to the driver with the Properties object. The following is a code example which sets connection attributes in the Properties object.

```
Properties sProps = new Properties();
sProps.put("user", "SYS");
sProps.put("password", "MANAGER");
```

#### Connecting to the Database 

The database can be connected to with the connection URL and connection information. The following is a code example which connects to the database and acquires the Connection object.

```
Connection sCon = sDriver.connect(sURL, sProps);
```



The format of the connection URL used for the argument of the connect method above is shown below:

```
jdbc:Altibase://server_ip:server_port/dbname
```



#### Example

```
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.Driver;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.util.Properties;
public class ConnectionExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
    {
        String sURL = "jdbc:Altibase://localhost:20300/mydb";
        Properties sProps = new Properties();
        sProps.put("user", "SYS");
        sProps.put("password", "MANAGER");
        Class.forName("Altibase.jdbc.driver.AltibaseDriver");
        Driver sDriver = DriverManager.getDriver(sURL);
        Connection sCon = sDriver.connect(sURL, sProps);
    }
}
```



#### Compiling and Running

The JDBC application can be compiled and ran as follows:

```
$ javac ConnectionExample.java
$ java ConnectionExample
```

### Connection Information

This section describes the connection properties that are available when connecting to Altibase, and explains how to set the connection properties.

#### Setting Connection Attributes

Connection attributes necessary for database connection can be set in the Properties object or specified in the connection URL.

##### Using the Connection URL

The value of the property can be specified by suffixing a “?” at the end of the connection URL and following it with the “key=value“ format. Multiple properties can be input by connecting them with an “&“.

The following is an example of a connection URL.

```
"jdbc:Altibase://localhost:20300/mydb?fetch_enough=0&time_zone=DB_TZ"
```

##### Using the Properties Object

After the Properties object has been created and the key and value have been input, it is ready to be used as connection information.

The following example uses the Properties object:

```
Properties sProps = new Properties();
sProps.put("fetch_enough", "30");
sProps.put("time_zone", "DB_TZ");
 
...
 
Connection sCon = DriverManager.getConnection( sURL, sProps );
```



#### About Connection Attributes

This section offers descriptions of the connection attributes available for use when connecting to Altibase. The following items are included in the description of each attribute:

-   Default value: The value used by default, if no other value is specified

-   Range: The value available for specification

-   Mandatory: Whether or not the attribute must be specified

-   Setting range: Whether the attribute which is set affects the whole system or only affects the given session.

### Using Statement and ResultSet

This section offers basic instructions through program codes on how to connect to the Altibase server and execute SQL statements with JDBC. For convenience, instructions on how to handle exceptions are omitted.

#### Example

```
import java.util.Properties;
import java.sql.*;

//...

String sURL      = "jdbc:Altibase://localhost:20300/mydb";
String sUser     = "SYS";
String sPassword = "MANAGER";
 
Connection sCon = null;
 
//Set properties for Connection    
Properties sProps = new Properties();
sProps.put( "user",     sUser);
sProps.put( "password", sPassword);
 
// Load class to register Driver into DriverManager   
Class.forName("Altibase.jdbc.driver.AltibaseDriver");
 
// Create a Connection Object
sCon = DriverManager.getConnection( sURL, sProps );
 
// Create a Statement Object
Statement sStmt = sCon.createStatement();
 
// Execute DDL Type Query
sStmt.execute("CREATE TABLE TEST ( C1 VARCHAR (10) )");
 
// Execute Inserting Query
sStmt.execute("INSERT INTO TEST VALUES ('ABCDE')");
 
// Execute Selecting Query
// Get Result Set from the Statement Object
ResultSet sRs = sStmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM TEST");
 
// Get ResultSetMetaData Object
ResultSetMetaData sRsMd = sRs.getMetaData();
 
// Retrieve ResultSet
while(sRs.next())
{
    for(int i=1; i<=sRsMd.getColumnCount(); i++)
    {
        // Get Actual Data and Printout
        System.out.println(sRs.getObject(i));
    }
}

sRs.close();
sStmt.close();
```



### JDBC Connection Failover

Due to the termination of one server in an environment where multiple Altibase servers are running, network failure or etc., the service of an application implemented with the Altibase JDBC driver can be compromised. In the event of such a failure, the client which connected to the server on which the failure occurred detects the situation and automatically connects to another server and processes the statements that were being executed; this process is called a Fail-Over. For instructions on how to use the Fail-Over feature in JDBC applications, please refer to the Chapter 4  of *Replication Manual.*

## 2. Basic Functions

Database objects can be used with the Altibase JDBC driver in the same manner as using the standard JDBC interface. 

This chapter explains how to connect to the database server with an IPv6 address and comparatively describes three statements that can be used in JDBC application programs. 

### IPv6 Connectivity

The Altibase JDBC driver supports the use of IPv6 addresses and host names conversible to IPv6 addresses in the JDBC URL.

#### Overview

To specify an IPv6 address in the URL, the address must be enclosed in square brackets (“[ ]”). For example, when specifying the localhost to an IP address, brackets are not used for writing the IPv4 address, 127.0.0.1. Meanwhile, brackets are necessary for using the IPv6 address, [::1]. For more detailed information on IPv6 address notation, please refer to *Administrator’s Manual.*

#### Prerequisites 

##### java.net.preferIPv4Stack

To connect with an IPv6 address, the java.net.preferIPv4Stack property must be set to FALSE when the client runs. 

If this property is set to TRUE, the client application cannot connect to the database server with an IPv6 address.

```
$ java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=false sample [::1]
```

##### java.net.preferIPv6Addresses

Regardless of whether the java.net.preferIPv6Addresses property is set to TRUE or FALSE, the Altibase JDBC driver is not affected.

##### PREFER_IPV6

If the host name is input to the server_ip property of the URL, the JDBC driver converts the host name to an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address, depending on the value specified for the PREFER_IPV6 property. 

If this property is TRUE, and the host name is input to the server_ip property, the client application first converts the host name to an IPv6 address. 

If this property is omitted or set to FALSE, however, the client application program first converts the host name to an IPv4 address.

If the client application fails on its first attempt to connect, it will attempt to re-connect with an IP address of a different version from the first.

#### How to Use IPv6

For IP addresses of the IPv6 format, the address value is available for specification as it is.

Whether the JDBC driver is to convert the host name to an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address can be specified in the PREFER_IPV6 property.

```
Properties sProps = new Properties();
...
sProps.put( "PREFER_IPV6", "FALSE");
```

If the PREFER_IPV6 property is set to FALSE as above, the JDBC driver converts the host name to an IPv4 address. If the PREFER_IPV6 property is TRUE and the host name is given, the application first converts the host name to an IPv6 address. 

If this property is omitted or set to FALSE, the client application first converts the host name to an IPv4 address. The basic operation of a JDBC driver is the conversion of the host name to an IPv4 address. 

If the client application fails on its first attempt to connect with an IP address of a preferred version, it will attempt to re-connect with an IP address of another version.

#### Examples

```
Connection sCon = null;
Properties sProps = new Properties();
 
sProps.put( "user", "SYS");
sProps.put( "password", "MANAGER");
sProps.put( "PREFER_IPV6", "FALSE");
 
String sURL = “jdbc:Altibase://localhost:20300/mydb";
Connection sCon = DriverManager.getConnection( sURL, sProps );
```



### Statement, PreparedStatement 및 CallableStatement

Depending on whether or not an in/out parameter is used in a SQL statement or whether or not a SQL statement is directly executed, different Statement objects are available for use in JDBC. The following table shows whether or not the PREPARE function and in/output parameters are available for use for each Statement.

|                   | PREPARE | IN Parameter | OUT Parameter |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Statement         | X       | X            | X             |
| PreparedStatement | O       | O            | X             |
| CallableStatement | O       | O            | O             |



#### Statement

Statement is mainly used for directly executing static SQL statements.

#### PreparedStatement

PreparedStatement is mainly used for preparing the SQL statement before executing it. When the same statement is repeatedly executed, improved performance can be anticipated with the use of PreparedStatement, instead of Statement. 

When the PreparedStatement object is created, the Altibase JDBC driver commands the server to PREPARE the statement. If the server fails to PREPARE, an error is returned and the JDBC driver throws an exception. 

Unlike Statement, input parameters can be used for PreparedStatement. A parameter is indicated as the “?” character within a SQL statement and can be set to a value with the setXXX() method. 

##### Example

The following is a code example using IN parameters with PreparedStatement.

```
PreparedStatement sPrepStmt = sConn.prepareCall("INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (?, ?)");
sPrepStmt.setInt(1, 1);
sPrepStmt.setString(2, "string-value");
sPrepStmt.execute();
sPrepStmt.close();
```



#### CallableStatement

CallableStatement can be used with an input or output parameter. CallableStatement is mainly used for calling a stored procedure or a stored function.

##### Example

The following is a code example using an IN parameter and an OUT parameter with CallableStatement.

```
CallableStatement sCallStmt = connection().prepareCall("{call p1(?, ?)");
sCallStmt.setInt(1, 1);
sCallStmt.registerOutParameter(2, Types.VARCHAR);
sCallStmt.execute();
 
String sOutVal = sCallStmt.getString(2);
// todo something ...
 
sCallStmt.close();
```



### Using the National Character Set 

This section offers instructions on how to use national character strings on UNICODE types, such as NCHAR or NVARCHAR types, in JDBC. 

#### Retrieving and Altering Data

Data of NCHAR/NVARCHAR data types can be retrieved and altered with JDBC in the same manner as retrieving and altering data of CHAR/VARCHAR types. The same methods used for the CHAR data type, such as getString and setString etc., can be used.

#### Using Constant Strings

How to use a constant string with a national character in a SQL statement is shown below:

-   Set the NcharLiteralReplace property to TRUE when connecting to the server. 
-   To use a national character string in a SQL statement as a constant string, prefix ‘N’ to the string. 

##### Example

```
// create table t1 (c1 nvarchar(1000)); 
Properties sProps; 
sProps.put( "user", "SYS"); 
sProps.put( "password", "MANAGER"); 
sProps.put( "NcharLiteralReplace", "true"); 
Connection sCon = DriverManager.getConnection( sURL, sProps ); 

Statement sStmt = sCon.createStatement(); 
sStmt.execute("insert into t1 values (N'AB가나')"); 
ResultSet sRS = sStmt.executeQuery( "select * from t1 where c1 like N'%가나%'");
```



## 3. Advanced Functions

This chapter introduces advanced functions provided by the Altibase JDBC driver and explains how to use them.

### Auto-generated Keys

Auto-generated keys are values which distinctly point to each row in a table, and are automatically generated in the database. 

In Altibase, a sequence can act as auto-generated keys. This section explains how to obtain the values of auto-generated keys in JDBC. 

#### How to Use Auto-generated Keys

To obtain an auto-generated key, first the Statement object is executed with a method specifying the column for which auto-generated keys are to be obtained. The ResultSet of the auto-generated keys can be retrieved with the getGeneratedKeys() method. 

Or, after having created the PreparedStatement object with a method specifying the column for which auto-generated keys are to be obtained and executing it, the ResultSet of the autogenerated keys can be retrieved with the getGeneratedKeys() method. 

The following are Statement methods that execute SQL statements which retrieve autogenerated keys.

```
public boolean execute(String aSql, int aAutoGeneratedKeys) throws SQLException; 
public boolean execute(String aSql, int[] aColumnIndexes) throws SQLException; 
public boolean execute(String aSql, String[] aColumnNames) throws SQLException;
```

The following are Connection methods that create the PreparedStatement object which retrieve auto-generated keys.

```
public PreparedStatement prepareStatement(String aSql, int aAutoGeneratedKeys) throws SQLException; 
public PreparedStatement prepareStatement(String aSql, int[] aColumnIndexes) throws SQLException; 
public PreparedStatement prepareStatement(String aSql, String[] aColumnNames) throws SQLException;
```

After having executed a SQL statement in one of the above two ways, auto-generated keys can be obtained by a ResultSet object with the following Statement method.

```
public ResultSet getGeneratedKeys() throws SQLException;
```



#### Restrictions

When obtaining auto-generated keys in Altibase, the following restrictions apply:

-   Its use is only supported for simple INSERT statements.

-   Since Altibase does not support columns with the AUTO INCREMENT property, autogenerated keys can only be obtained from a sequence.

The following is an example of a SQL statement from which auto-generated keys can be obtained.

```
INSERT INTO t1 (id, val) VALUES (t1_id_seq.nextval, ?);
```

The following is an example of a SQL statement from which auto-generated keys cannot be obtained.

```
SELECT * FROM t1;
EXEC p1;
```

If a SQL statement which does not produce auto-generated keys is executed with the generator flag (Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS), the flag is ignored and the getGeneratedKeys() method returns an empty result set.



#### Example

```
sStmt.executeUpdate(sQstr, Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS);
ResultSet sKeys = sStmt.getGeneratedKeys();
while (sKeys.next())
{
    int sKey = sKeys.getInt(1);
 
    // do somethings...
}
sKeys.close();
sStmt.close();
```



### Timeout

This section gives an explanation of timeouts which can occur in a client session connected to the Altibase server and provides code examples to show how to set properties related to timeouts.

#### Login Timeout

A login timeout occurs when a connect method of a Connection object is called and a response is not received from the server within the maximum waiting time. The maximum waiting time is set in the login_timeout property and the unit is seconds.

##### Code Examples

The following are code examples which show two ways to set the login_timeout property.

1. Create a Connection object with the Properties object to which the timeout property has been added.
  
```
   Properties sProps = new Properties();
   ...
   sProps("login_timeout", "100");
   ...
   Connection sCon = DriverManager.getConnection( sUrl, sProps );
```

2. Create a Connection object with a connection URL which specifies the timeout property.

   ```
   String sUrl = "jdbc:Altibase://localhost:20300/mydb?login_timeout=100";
   Connection sCon = DriverManager.getConnection( sUrl );
   ```


####  Response Timeout

A response timeout occurs when the maximum waiting time for a response from the Altibase server is exceeded. The maximum waiting time is set in the response_timeout property and the unit is seconds. 

This value is applied to all methods which communicate with the server.

##### Code Examples

The following are code examples which show different ways to set the response_timeout property

1. Create a Connection object with a Properties object to which the timeout property has been added.
  
```
   Properties sProps = new Properties();
   ...
   sProps("response_timeout", "100");
   ...
   Connection sCon = DriverManager.getConnection( sUrl, sProps );
```

2. Create a Connection object with a connection URL which specifies the timeout property.

   ```
   String sUrl = "jdbc:Altibase://localhost:20300/mydb?response_timeout=100";
   Connection sCon = DriverManager.getConnection( sUrl );
   ```

3. Pass it as an argument when the application is running.

   ```
   java ... -DALTIBASE_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT=100 ...
   ```

4. Set the environment variable.

   ```
   // Linux
   export ALTIBASE_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT=100
   ```


### DataSource

The Altibase JDBC driver offers a way to connect to the database with a file that contains connection configurations. Datasource is the set of connection information to a database server in the configuration file.

#### How to set DataSource

DataSource is set in the following format to the altibase_cli.ini file.

```
# comment
 
[ datasource_name ]
Server=localhost # comment
Port=20300
User=sys
Password=manager
```

Additional connection properties can be added by writing strings of the “key=value” format in lines. 

The JDBC driver searches for the altibase_cli.ini file in the paths of the following order:.

1.  /altibase_cli.ini

2.  \$HOME/altibase_cli.ini

3.  \$ALTIBASE_HOME/conf/altibase_cli.ini

#### Connecting with DataSource

To connect to the server with DataSource, the DSN (DataSouce Name) specified in the altibase_cli.ini file should be specified in a connection URL, instead of the IP address and port number.

The following is an example of a connection URL using a DSN.

```
jdbc:Altibase://datasource_name
jdbc:Altibase://datasource_name:20301
jdbc:Altibase://datasource_name:20301?sys=user&password=pwd
```

When specifying a DSN in a connection URL, port or other properties can be additionally specified. If a property specified in the altibase_cli.ini file is duplicately specified in a connection URL, however, the file value is ignored and the connection URL value is used.

### Connection Pool

A Connection Pool can be set and managed in the following manner.

-   Use AltibaseConnectionPoolDataSource: When using a Connection Pool in WAS, specify this class in the JDBC Connection Pool configuration of WAS. The name of this class was ABConnectionPoolDataSource for Altibase JDBC drivers of versions prior to 6.3.1.

Property information configured in AltibaseConnectionPoolDataSource is as follows.

| Property Name  | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| databaseName   | Database name                                                |
| dataSourceName | DataSource Name                                              |
| loginTimeout   | Maximum wait time for database login                         |
| logWriter      | Log writer for DataSource                                    |
| password       | Database password                                            |
| portNumber     | Database port number                                         |
| serverName     | Database server name                                         |
| URL            | Connection string information for Altibase connections (uppercase note) |
| user           | Database user ID                                             |

### Multiple ResultSet

PSM(Stored procedures and stored functions) for Altibase can return a multiple number of result sets to the client. Using an example that returns multiple result sets, this section offers instructions through a code example on how to use these result sets in JDBC applications. 

The following is an example of a PSM which returns multiple result sets.

```
CREATE TYPESET my_type
AS
    TYPE my_cur IS REF CURSOR;
END;
 
CREATE PROCEDURE p1 (p1 OUT MY_TYPE.MY_CUR, p2 out MY_TYPE.MY_CUR)
AS
BEGIN
    OPEN p1 FOR 'SELECT * FROM t1';
    OPEN p1 FOR 'SELECT * FROM t2';
END;
```

The following is an example of a code which uses multiple result sets returned by a call to a PSM in a JDBC application.

```
CallableStatement sCallStmt = connection().prepareCall("{call p1()}");
sCallStmt.execute();
ResultSet sRs = null;
ResultSetMetaData sRsMd = null;
 
 
do{
    sRs = sCallStmt.getResultSet();
    sRsMd = sRs.getMetaData();
 
    if(sRsMd != null)
    {
        while(sRs.next())
        {
            // do something
            for(int i=1; i <= sRsMd.getColumnCount(); i++)
            {
                System.out.println(sRs.getString(i));
            }
        }
    }
}while(stmt.getMoreResults());
sCallStmt.close();
```



### JDBC and Failover

This section explains how to use the Failover feature in an Altibase JDBC application.

#### What is a Failover?

When a failure occurs on the database server and the connection is disconnected, a Failover is a feature which enables the application to immediately establish a connection to another server to continue the execution of the previously executed operation.

Failover can operate in the following two ways:

-   CTF(Connection Time Failover)  
    CTF attempts to connect to another server when an attempt to connect to the database is unsuccessful. CTF can occur when the connect method of a Connection object is called.
    
-   STF(Session Time Failover)  
    STF connects to another server and continuously executes the user-specified operation when a connection error occurs before the result of a SQL statement is received from the server. STF can occur on the execution of all methods communicating with the server, excluding the connect method.

For more detailed information on Failover, please refer to the “Failover” chapter of *Replication Manual.*

#### How to Use Failover

This section explains how to use the CTF and STF features in JDBC applications.

##### CTF

The CTF feature can be used by adding the following properties to the Properties object.

```
Properties sProps = new Properties();
sProps.put("alternateservers", "database1:20300, database2:20300");
sProps.put("connectionretrycount", "5");
sProps.put("connectionretrydelay", "2");
sProps.put("sessionfailover", "off");
```

For more detailed information on each of the properties, please refer to “Connection Information” of Chapter 1. 

##### STF

The STF feature can be used by additionally setting "SessionFailover=on" to the properties which set the CTF feature.

In communication situations other than attempting to establish connection to the database server, the client first processes CTF and restores the connection when it detects server failure. Thereafter, the client executes the callback function registered by the user and raises a Failover Success Exception for the user to acknowledge that a Failover has occurred. If Failover fails to every server, the driver throws the Exception which originally occurred. 

The following is an interface for the Failover callback function written by the user.

```
public interface AltibaseFailoverCallback
{
    public final static class Event
    {
        public static final int BEGIN     = 0;
        public static final int COMPLETED = 1;
        public static final int ABORT     = 2;
    }
    public final static class Result
    {
        public static final int GO   = 3;
        public static final int QUIT = 4;
    }
    int failoverCallback(Connection aConnection,
                         Object     aAppContext,
                         int        aFailoverEvent);
};
```

The following is a code example which shows the process of a user registering and freeing a Failover callback function.

```
public class  UserDefinedFailoverCallback implements AltibaseFailoverCallback
{
    ...
 
    public int failoverCallback(Connection aConnection,
                                Object     aAppContext,
                                int        aFailoverEvent)
    {
        // User Defined Code
        // Must return either Result.GO or Result.QUIT.
    }
 
    ...
}
```

If the Failover callback function written by the user is called by the JDBC driver, one of the Event constants included in the above AltibaseFailoverCallback interface is passed to aFailoverEvent, which is the third argument of the callback function. The meaning of each Event constant is as follows:

-   Event.BEGIN: Session Failover is started

-   Event.COMPLETED: Session Failover has succeeded

-   Event.ABORT: Session Failover has failed

The Result constants included in the AltibaseFailoverCallback interface are values which can be returned by the callback function written by the user. If values other than Result constants are returned from the callback function, Failover does not operate normally.

-   Result.GO: If this constant value is returned from the callback function, the JDBC driver continually runs the next process of STF. 
-   Result.QUIT: If this constant value is returned from the callback function, the JDBC driver terminates the STF process. 

The following is a code example of an object which can be used as the second argument of the Failover callback function written by the user.

```
public class UserDefinedAppContext
{
    // User Defined Code
}
```

If there is a need to use information of an application implemented by the user during the STF process, the object to be passed to the callback function while registering the Failover callback function can be specified. If this object is specified as the second argument of the registerFailoverCallback method which registers the callback function, this object is passed when the callback function is actually called. The following is an example which depicts this process in code.

```
// Create a user-defined callback function object.
UserDefinedFailoverCallback sCallback = new UserDefinedFailoverCallback();
// Create a user-defined application information object
UserDefinedAppContext sAppContext = new UserDefinedAppContext();

...

Connection sCon = DriverManager.getConnection(sURL, sProp);
// Register the callback function with the user-defined application object
((AltibaseConnection)sCon).registerFailoverCallback(sCallback, sAppContext);

...

// Free the callback function
((AltibaseConnection)sCon).deregisterFailoverCallback();
```



#### Code Example

This is a code example which implements a callback function for STF.

The following is an example of a simple code which is regardless of various circumstances; therefore, it should be noted that it cannot be used as it is in user applications.

```
public class MyFailoverCallback implements AltibaseFailoverCallback
{
    public int failoverCallback(Connection aConnection, Object aAppContext,int aFailoverEvent)
    {
        Statement sStmt = null;
        ResultSet sRes = null;
  
        switch (aFailoverEvent)
        {
            // Necessary operations before starting Failover on the user application logic can be executed.
 case Event.BEGIN:
                System.out.println(“Failover Started .... “);
                break;
            // Necessary operations after completing Failover on the user application logic can be executed.
 case Event.COMPLETED:
                try
                {
                    sStmt = aConnection.createStatement();
                }
                catch( SQLException ex1 )
                {
                    try
                    {
                        sStmt.close();
                    }
                    catch( SQLException ex3 )
                    {
                    }
                    return Result.QUIT;
                }
  
                try
                {
                    sRes = sStmt.executeQuery("select 1 from dual");
                    while(sRes.next())
                    {
                        if(sRes.getInt(1) == 1 )
                        {
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
                catch ( SQLException ex2 )
                {
                    try
                    {
                        sStmt.close();
                    }
                    catch( SQLException ex3 )
                    {
                    }
                    // Terminates the Failover process.
                    return Result.QUIT;
                }
                break;
        }
        // Continues the Failover process.
        return Result.GO;
    }
}
```

The following is a code example which checks whether or not STF was successful. Whether STF succeeded or failed can be confirmed by checking whether ErrorCode of SQLException is identical to Validation.FAILOVER_SUCCESS. The Failover validation code is inserted inside the while loop because the operation which was previously under execution must be executed again, even if Failover succeeds.

```
// Must be implemented so that the operation to be executed can be re-executed..
// The while loop has been used in this case.
while (true)
{
    try
    {
        sStmt = sConn.createStatement();
        sRes = sStmt.executeQuery("SELECT C1 FROM T1");
        while (sRes.next())
        {
            System.out.println("VALUE : " + sRes.getString(1));
        }
    }
    catch (SQLException e)
    {
        // Whether or not the Failover has succeeded.
        if (e.getErrorCode() == AltibaseFailoverCallback.FailoverValidation.FAILOVER_SUCCESS)
        {
            // Since Failover has succeeded, Exception is ignored and the process is continued. continue;
        }
        System.out.println("EXCEPTION : " + e.getMessage());
    }
    break;
}
```



### JDBC Escapes

The JDBC specification provides the escape syntax for the JDBC application to understand vendor specific SQL for database products. The JDBC driver converts a SQL statement which includes the escape syntax to a native SQL statement for its database. 

The following table is an organization of SQL statements which include the escape syntax supported by the JDBC specification and SQL statements converted by the JDBC driver for use in Altibase.

### RHow to Use ResultSet

This section describes the types of ResultSets supported by the Altibase JDBC driver and how to use them.

#### Creating ResultSet

A ResultSet is created when a query statement is executed on the database, and it corresponds to the ResultSet object of JDBC. 

The following methods create the ResultSet object in JDBC.

```
public Statement createStatement(int aResultSetType, int aResultSetConcurrency) throws SQLException;
 
public Statement createStatement(int aResultSetType, int aResultSetConcurrency, int aResultSetHoldability) throws SQLException;
 
public PreparedStatement prepareStatement(String aSql, int aResultSetType, int aResultSetConcurrency) throws SQLException;
 
public PreparedStatement prepareStatement(String aSql, int aResultSetType, int aResultSetConcurrency, int aResultSetHoldability) throws SQLException;
 
public CallableStatement prepareCall(String aSql, int aResultSetType, int aResultSetConcurrency) throws SQLException
 
public CallableStatement prepareCall(String aSql, int aResultSetType, int aResultSetConcurrency, int aResultSetHoldability) throws SQLExc
```



#### ResultSet Types

The ResultSet object of JDBC manages and retains the cursor which points to the current position within the result set. The cursor of a basic ResultSet object is not updateable and only moves forward; however, a scrollable and updateable ResultSet object can be created with the use of options.

The following are ResultSet object types available for user specification.

-   TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY  
    Unscrollable; the cursor can be moved only forward. Data of the ResultSet is determined at the point in time at which the cursor opens in the database server.
    
-   TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE  
    Scrollable; the cursor can be moved forward, backwards, or moved to a specified location. Data of the ResultSet is determined at the point in time at which the cursor opens in the database server. Memory can become scarce, due to caching the ResultSet retrieved from the server on the client.
    
-   TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE  
    Scrollable; the cursor can be moved forward, backwards, or moved to a specified location. The ResultSet is determined at the point in time at which the cursor opens in the database server; however, data within the ResultSet is determined at the point in time at which the client retrieves or updates it.

#### Concurrency

This option determines whether or not to allow updates through the ResultSet object. One of the following two constants is available for use:

-   CONCUR_READ_ONLY  
    Does not allow updates; the default value.

-   CONCUR_UPDATABLE  
    Allows updates with the ResultSet object. 

#### Holdability

This option determines whether or not to retain the ResultSet object after the transaction has been committed. One of the following two constants are available for use:

-   CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT  
    The cursor is closed when the transaction is committed.

-   HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT  
    The cursor is left open, even if the transaction is committed. If the transaction has been committed at least once after the cursor has been opened, the cursor is left open during future commit and rollback operations. If the transaction has not been committed even once since the cursor has been opened, however, the cursor is closed when the transaction is rolled back. 

##### Notes

-   Since the JDBC driver caches as many number of rows as the value set for FetchSize for the ResultSet object on the client, data left in the cache can be retrieved by the application, even if the cursor is closed. If you want the application to immediately detect that the cursor has been closed, set FetchSize to 1.
  

* The default value of Holdability for the Altibase JDBC driver is CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT, and is different from the default value for the JDBC specification, HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT.  

Open ResultSet objects must be closed prior to switching the autocommit mode with the setAutoCommit() method in a session where Holdability is HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT. The following is a code example which raises an error.

```
sCon = getConnection();
sStmt = sCon.createStatement();
byte[] br;
byte[] bb = new byte[48];
for(byte i = 0; i < bb.length;i++) bb[i] = i;

sCon.setAutoCommit(false);

sStmt.executeUpdate("insert into Varbinary_Tab values(null)");
sCon.commit();

sPreStmt = sCon.prepareStatement("update Varbinary_Tab set VARBINARY_VAL=?");
sPreStmt.setObject(1, bb, java.sql.Types.VARBINARY);
sPreStmt.executeUpdate();

sRS = sStmt.executeQuery("Select VARBINARY_VAL from Varbinary_Tab");
sRS.next();
br = sRS.getBytes(1);

sCon.commit();
sCon.setAutoCommit(true); -> (1)

```


The following exception is raised at 1.

```
java.sql.SQLException: Several statements still open
    at Altibase.jdbc.driver.ex.Error.processServerError(Error.java:320)
    at Altibase.jdbc.driver.AltibaseConnection.setAutoCommit(AltibaseConnection.java:988)
    at HodabilityTest.testHoldability(HodabilityTest.java:46)
    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)
    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:57)
    at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)
    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:616)

```

sRs.close() must be called before sCon.setAutoCommit(true) to not raise an exception.

-   ?  :  The client session must be in Non-Autocommit mode or the clientside_auto_commit connection attribute must be set to on to use a ResultSet object whose Holdability type is HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT. 
     If the clientside_auto_commit connection attribute is set to on, the Holdability type is automatically changed to HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT.

##### Example

```
Statement sUpdStmt = sConn.prepareStatement("UPDATE t1 SET val = ? WHERE id = ?");
Statement sSelStmt = sConn.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY, ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT);
ResultSet sRS = sSelStmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM t1");
while (sRS.next())
{
    // TODO : set parameters
 
    sUpdStmt.execute();
    sConn.commit();
}
sRS.close();
```



#### Restrictions

To use an Updatable ResultSet or a Scrollable ResultSet, a SELECT query statement which retrieves the ResultSet is restricted in the following ways:

To use an Updatable ResultSet,

-   Only one table can be specified in the FROM clause. 
-   Only pure columns can be specified in the SELECT list; expressions or functions cannot be included. Columns with a NOT NULL constraint, and without a default value must be included in the SELECT list.

To use a Scrollable-Sensitive ResultSet,

-   Only one table can be specified in the FROM clause.

When executing PSM, only ResultSet objects of the default type are available for use. If the user specifies an option which is not of the default type, the option is ignored.

Since for a ResultSet object which is CONCUR_UPDATABLE and TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE, one more Statement is used within the JDBC driver, it can easily exceed the limited number of Statements; therefore, the maximum number of Statements must be set for occasions on which such ResultSet types are used a lot. 

Since an updateable and scrollable ResultSet contains a large amount of data, its memory usage is higher than a forward only ResultSet. A large ResultSet can cause memory to become scarce, so its use is not recommended. 

The characteristics of the ResultSet are determined by the ResultSet type, concurrency type and holdability type described above. The user can specify random combinations for these three values; however, depending on the query statement that generates the ResultSet, the user-defined combination can be invalid. In this case, the driver does not raise an exception, but converts it to a valid combination. In the following example, the invalid types on the left side are automatically converted to the valid types on the right side.

-   TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE → TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE

-   CONCUR_UPDATABLE → CONCUR_READ_ONLY

-   HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT → CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT

When a conversion is made internally, whether or not a conversion has occurred can be confirmed through warnings.

If the type of ResultSet object is TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE, the result of the result set is limited to 349,502 due to the increase of memory usage. If this value is exceeded, a dynamic array cursor overflow error may occur.

#### Detecting Holes

A ResultSet object of the TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE type retrieves the newest data from the server when performing a FETCH. Therefore, a row which was visible when the cursor opened can become invisible as the row is scrolled. For example, if a row in a ResultSet object is deleted by another Statement, the row is no longer visible in the ResultSet object. Such an invisible row is called a Hole.

The following is a code example which detects Holes in JDBC.

```
while (sRS.next())
{
    if (sRS.rowDeleted())
    {
        // HOLE DETECTED!!!
    }
    else
    {
        // do something ...
    }
}
```

Valid data cannot be obtained from a Hole, and a ResultSet returns one of the following values for a Hole

- A SQL data type NULL
- A reference type NULL
- The value 0.



  #### Fetch Size


When retrieving data for the ResultSet object from the server, the Altibase JDBC driver retrieves multiple rows at once, instead of retrieving one row each time, and caches them in the client to enhance performance. This is called a prefetch, and the number of rows to be fetched can be set with the setFetchSize() method of the Statement object.

```
public void setFetchSize(int aRows) throws SQLException;
```

A value between the range of 0 to 2147483647 can be set for the Altibase JDBC driver. The JDBC specification defines that an exception must be raised when a value outside of this range is specified; however, the Altibase JDBC driver does not raise an exception and ignores it, for the sake of convenience.

If the value is set to 0, the Altibase server voluntarily determines the size to return to the client in one go. In this case, the number of rows to be returned differ, according to the size of a row.

The FetchSize value is especially important for the Scroll-Sensitive ResultSet. When the user retrieves data from a Scroll-Sensitive ResultSet, the driver returns the prefetched rows first. Even if data of the database has been updated, as long as the row exists in the prefetched cache, data of the cache is returned to the user. If the user wants to see the newest data of the database, FetchSize should be set to 1. By doing so, however, the frequency of retrieving data from the server increases and performance can be lowered.

#### Refreshing Rows

With the refreshRow() method of the ResultSet object, data which has been previously retrieved from the server can be re-fetched, without executing the SELECT statement. The refreshRow() method retrieves as many number of rows as the value set for FetchSize, based on the current row. To use this method, a cursor must be pointing to any row in the ResultSet. 

This method operates when the ResultSet object is of the following types:

-   TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE & CONCUR_UPDATABLE

-   TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE & CONCUR_READ_ONLY

If this method is called for a TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY type, an exception is raised; for a TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE type, nothing happens.

### Atomic Batch

The Altibase JDBC driver not only guarantees the atomicity of batch operations, but also supports fast INSERT operations of bulk data through the Atomic Batch feature. 

This section explains how to use the Atomic Batch feature which the Altibase JDBC driver supports. 

#### How to Use Atomic Batch

In order to use the Atomic Batch feature, you must first create the PreparedStatement object and then cast the object to the AltibasePreparedStatement class type in java programming. 

The following method, setAtmoicBatch(), can be used to enable the Atomic Batch feature. 

```
public void setAtomicBatch(boolean aValue) throws SQLException
```

To confirm whether or not Atomic Batch is set for the PreparedStatement object, call the getAtomicBatch() method as below. 

```
public boolean getAtomicBatch()
```



#### Restrictions

When using the Atomic Batch feature in Altibase, the following restrictions apply:

-   Only supports simple INSERT statements. Consistency for complex INSERT statements or DML statements, such as UPDATE, DELETE, etc., cannot be assured. 
  
-   If a trigger fires with Each Statement as the unit, the trigger fires only once. 
  
-   SYSDATE operates only once.



#### Example

```
......
Connection con = sConn = DriverManager.getConnection(aConnectionStr, mProps);
Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
 
try
{ 
    stmt.execute("Drop table " + TABLE_NAME); } catch (SQLException e) { }
    stmt.execute("create table " + TABLE_NAME + "(c1 VARCHAR (1000))");
 
    PreparedStatement sPrepareStmt = con.prepareStatement("insert into " + TABLE_NAME + " values(?)");
    ((AltibasePreparedStatement)sPrepareStmt).setAtomicBatch(true);
 
    for(int i = 1; i <= MAX_RECORD_CNT; i++)
    {
        sPrepareStmt.setString(1, String.valueOf(i % 50));
        sPrepareStmt.addBatch();
 
        if(i%BATCH_SIZE == 0)
        {
            sPrepareStmt.executeBatch();       
            con.commit();
        }
    }
    con.commit();
} 
catch (SQLException e) 
{
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
......
```



### Date, Time, Timestamp

This section explains the meanings of Date, Time, and Timestamp which are DATE types, and describes the data conversion range supported by the Altibase JDBC driver.

#### Meanings

-   Date:  Expresses only the date 
-   Time: Expresses the time(the date can be included) 
-   Timestamp: Expresses the date, time, seconds and further subdivisions of time

#### Conversion Table

The following table shows the formats that are processed by the Altibase JDBC driver according to the object type passed to the setObject method.

| Delivery Object            | String                                                       | Date                                                         | Time                                      | Timestamp                  |

### GEOMETRY

This section offers instructions on how to use GEOMETRY type data provided by Altibase in JDBC applications

#### How To Use GEOMETRY

GEOMETRY type data can be used with the byte array in Altibase JDBC applications. 

When inserting data(including NULL) to a GEOMETRY type column in the database with the IN parameter of PreparedStatement, the data type must be specified with the AltibaseTypes.GEOMETRY constant. 

For more detailed information on how to directly write GEOMETRY type data in a query statement, please refer to Spatial SQL Reference.

#### Examples

The following is code example which inserts data to a GEOMETRY type column in a JDBC application.

```
int sSize = ... ;
byte[] sGeometryData = new byte[sSize];
 
Connection sConn = ... ;
PreparedStatement sPstmt = sConn.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO TEST_TABLE VALUES (?)");
sPstmt.setObject(1, sGeometryData, AltibaseTypes.GEOMETRY);
sPstmt.executeQuery();
 
...
```



### LOB

This sections offers instructions on how to use LOB type data provided by Altibase in a JDBC application.

#### Prerequisites

-   Altibase supports the LOB data types, BLOB and CLOB, and each can have the maximum size of 2Gbytes.

To manipulate LOB data, the autocommit mode of a session must satisfy one of the following conditions.

-   The autocommit mode of a session must be disabled with setAutoCommit(false) of the Connection object and the user must manually control transactions. 
-   Clientside_auto_commit must be set to on to enable the JDBC driver to control the autocommit operations of transactions.

#### Using BLOB

How to manipulate BLOB data in a JDBC application is shown in the following code examples.

##### Writing BLOB Data Through the PreparedStatement Object

    // After executing this method
    // sClob.length() == sLength
    sClob.truncate(sLength);
}
 
...
```



#### Freeing Resources

For JDBC applications which obtain data through a large number of LOB objects, the obtained LOB objects must be freed. The LOB object must be freed specifically, regardless of whether or not the transaction is committed. 

The following is a code example which frees a Blob object.

```
...
Blob sBlob = sRs.getBlob(1);
// Freeing Lob Locator
((Altibase.jdbc.driver.AltibaseLob)sBlob).free();
...
```

As for Blob objects, further operations cannot be executed on an object if a Clob object is freed with the free method, since the corresponding Lob Locator is freed from the server. 

The following is a code example which frees the BlobInputStream and BlobOutputStream objects.

```
...
Clob sClob = sRs.getClob(1);
// Freeing Lob Locator
((Altibase.jdbc.driver.AltibaseLob)sClob).free();
...
```

Further operations cannot be executed on an object if the BlobInputStream object or the BlobOutputStream object is freed with the freeLocator method, since the corresponding Lob Locator is freed from the server. 

The following is a code example which frees the ClobReader and ClobWriter objects.

```
InputStream sInputStream = sRs.getBinaryStream(1);
 
// Freeing Lob Locator
((Altibase.jdbc.driver.BlobInputStream)sInputStream).freeLocator();


CallableStatement sCallStmt = aConn.prepareCall("INSERT INTO TEST_TABLE VALUES (?)");
sCallStmt.registerOutParameter(1, Types.BLOB);
sCallStmt.execute();
 
Blob sBlob = sCallStmt.getBlob(1);
OutputStream sOutputStream = sBlob.setBinaryStream(1);
 
// Freeing Lob Locator
((Altibase.jdbc.driver.BlobOutputStream)sOutputStream).freeLocator();

```

Further operations cannot be executed on an object if the BlobInputStream object or the BlobOutputStream object is freed with the freeLocator method, since the corresponding Lob Locator is freed from the server.

The following is a code example which frees the ClobReader and ClobWriter objects.

```
Reader sClobReader = sRs.getCharacterStream(1);
 
// Freeing Lob Locator
((Altibase.jdbc.driver.ClobReader)sClobReader).freeLocator();


CallableStatement sCallStmt = aConn.prepareCall("INSERT INTO TEST_TABLE VALUES (?)");
sCallStmt.registerOutParameter(1, Types.CLOB);
sCallStmt.execute();
 
Clob sClob = sCallStmt.getClob(1);
Writer sClobWriter = sClob.setCharacterStream(1);
 
// Freeing Lob Locator
((Altibase.jdbc.driver.ClobWriter)sClobWriter).freeLocator();

```

Further operations cannot be executed on an object if the ClobReader object or the ClobWriter object is freed with the freeLocator method, since the corresponding Lob Locator is freed from the server.

#### Restrictions

Even if clientside_auto_commit is set to on to enable the JDBC driver to control the autocommit operations of transactions the following restrictions still apply to the manipulation of LOB data. 

If LOB data retrieved from the ResultSet object(cursor) is used with the executeUpdate() method of another Statement before the cursor is closed, no more fetch operations are possible from the cursor since the Lob locator is freed. The following is a code example which raises such an error.

```
PreparedStatement sPreStmt =
    sCon.prepareStatement( "INSERT INTO TEST_TEXT " +
                           "VALUES ( ?, ?, ?, ? )" );
Statement sStmt = sCon.createStatement();
ResultSet sRS = sStmt.executeQuery( "SELECT ID, TEXT " +
                                    "  FROM TEST_SAMPLE_TEXT " );
while ( sRS.next() ) -> (2)
{
    sID   = sRS.getInt( 1 );
    sClob = sRS.getClob( 2 );
    switch ( sID )
    {
        case 1 :
            sPreStmt.setInt(    1, 1 );
            sPreStmt.setString( 2, "Altibase Greetings" );
            sPreStmt.setClob(   3, sClob );
            sPreStmt.setInt(    4, (int)sClob.length() );
            break;
        case 2 :
            sPreStmt.setInt(    1, 2 );
            sPreStmt.setString( 2, "Main Memory DBMS" );
            sPreStmt.setClob(   3, sClob );
            sPreStmt.setInt(    4, (int)sClob.length() );
            break;
        default :
            break;
    }
    sPreStmt.executeUpdate(); -> (1)
}
```

(1):  If sPreStmt.executeUpdate() is called while ResultSet sRS is open, the JDBC driver automatically commits transactions and by doing so, the Lob locator of sClob is freed.

(2): An exception can be raised at sRs.next() since the Lob locator is freed

Thus, when manipulating LOB data in such a logic as above, the autocommit mode of a session must first be disabled by calling setAutoCommit(false).

### Controlling Autocommit

The autocommit mode of a session can be set with the auto_commit connection attribute or the setAutoCommit method of the JDBC Connection object for Altibase JDBC applications. If autocommit is enabled with auto_commit=true or the setAutoCommit(true) method, the Altibase server automatically commits transactions. 

Autocommit can also be enabled with the clientside_auto_commit connection attribute. If clientside_auto_commit is set to on, instead of the Altibase server, the JDBC driver automatically commits transactions. 

When clientside_auto_commit is set to off, the autocommit mode of a session is determined by the setAutoCommit method. 

To disable autocommit for a session, call setAutoCommit(false). 

Calling setAutoCommit(false) on a client_auto_commit=on session disables autocommit and calling setAutoCommit(true) thereafter restores the session to the autocommit mode of the JDBC driver. 

When autocommit is disabled, the user must manually commit or rollback with the commit() or rollback() method. 

The following table sums up the above.

| Autocommit Mode                                | How to set                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server automatically commits transactions      | auto_commit=true(or omitted) or setAutoCommit(true)        |
| JDBC driver automatically commits transactions | auto_commit=true(or omitted) and clientside_auto_commit=on |
| Autocommit is disabled                         | auto_commit=false or setAutoCommit(false)                  |

### BIT, VARBIT

This section offers information on managing BIT,VARBIT type data in JDBC application and related considerations.

#### How to Use

BIT, VARBIT type data can be manipulated by using Java BitSet class in ALTIBASE HDB JDBC application. 

When using IN parameter of PreparedStatement, either the Types.BIT type should be specified or the value can be specififed with BitSet or a character string when not specifying the type.

#### Notes

In order to create BIT,VARBIT value with a bit ending with '0', use AltibaseBitSet which can be set with bit values of specified length or character string values. The Java BitSet is implemented to remember which bits have been set () because a BIT value of 0 length cannot be created.

#### Example

The following is an example code for inserting data in BIT, VARBIT type columns in JDBC application.

```
...
BitSet sBitSet1 = new BitSet();
sBitSet1.set(1);
BitSet sBitSet2 = new AltibaseBitSet( 5 );
sBitSet1.set(2);

PreparedStatement sPstmt = sConn.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO TEST_TABLE VALUES (?)");
sPstmt.setObject(1, sBitSet1, Types.BIT);
sPstmt.executeUpdate();
sPstmt.setObject(1, sBitSet2);
sPstmt.executeUpdate();
sPstmt.setObject(1, "0110100", Types.BIT);
sPstmt.executeUpdate();
...
```



### JDBC Logging

JJDBC Logging means to record all sorts of logs occurring in the Altibase JDBC driver, and the log can be recorded by using java.util.logging package. This section will discuss how to use and configure the JDBC logging.

#### Installing JDBC Logging

JIn order to record a log from the JDBC driver, the JDBC jar file with an added logging function should be used. Also, it should be used after activating a logging function in the ALTIBASE_JDBC_TRACE environment variable.

##### JRE Version

JRE 1.5 or above must be installed in order to execute the JDBC logging and other library is not necessary.

##### Setting the CLASSPATH

To use the JDBC Logging, Altibase_t.jar file must be added to the CLASSPATH environment variable. 

ex) When using the bash shell in the Unix environment

```
export CLASSPATH=$ALTIBASE_HOME/lib/Altibase_t.jar:.:$CLASSPATH
```



##### Activating Logging

Global logging is activated without modifying a program by altering the ALTIBASE_JDBC_TRACE environment variables with JVM parameters. However, a client program should be re-started in order to apply the modified values of the ALTIBASE_JDBC_TRACE. 

```
java -DALTIBASE_JDBC_TRACE=true ...
```



#### Instruction on JDBC Logging

##### Setting java.util.logging file 

Setting java.util.logging can be executed in $JRE_HOME/lib/logging.properties or it can be separately configured on java.util.logging.config.file as follows. 

```
java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=$ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/JDBC/Logging/logging.properties -DALTIBASE_JDBC_TRACE=true ...
```

Altibase provide a logging.properties sample file in a directory of $ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/JDBC/Logging, and by using or referencing it the user can directly create a configuring file and use it Djava.util.logging.config.file property.

##### Logger Types

A Logger is constructed with a tree structure and it is used to partially adjust setting or the amount of logs. The logger types supported by Altibase JDBC driver are as follows.

| Logger                 | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| altibase.jdbc          | Altibase JDBC messages(JDBC API call, such as connection, statement, prepared statement, etc.) |
| altibase.jdbc.pool     | Messages regarding the connection pool                       |
| altibase.jdbc.rowset   | ResultSet message                                            |
| altibase.jdbc.xa       | xa messages                                                  |
| altibase.jdbc.failover | failover messages                                            |
| altibase.jdbc.cm       | CmChannel network packet messages                            |

##### Logger Levels

If a logger level is specified, the amount of logs can be concretely adjusted. The following table explicates the provided levels by Altibase JDBC driver, and the logs are left in detail more and more as it goes to FINEST from SEVER. If the CONFIG level is specified, logs of SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG levels are left. 	

| Logger level | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OFF          | Off is not record the log                                    |
| SEVERE       | SQLException or when an inner error occurred, the relevant logs are recorded in the SEVERE level. |
| WARNING      | SQLWarning is left the log in the WARNING level.             |
| INFO         | The JDBC driver internally logs by monitoring specific objects. |
| CONFIG       | This level is usually used to check what kind of a SQL statement is internally executed in the JDBC driver. In terms of the PreparedStatement, sql is displayed when preparing; however, in terms of a statement, the sql is displayed with milli sec unit when it is being executed. |
| FINE         | This level leaves argument values and return values in the log when entering to the standard JDBC API. The amount of logs can be large since logs are left when entering to the API, and the time which is taken for connection or statement to close is additionally displayed. |
| FINEST       | In the FINEST level, the packet information exchanged between JDBC driver and Altibase server is logged. It is the largest amount of logs. |

##### logging.properties 

The following is a logging.properties sample which leaves network packet logs with the log level of CONFIG. More information can be found in $ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/JDBC/Logging/logging.properties as well. .

```
handlers= java.util.logging.FileHandler, java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler --> FileHandler and ConsoleHandler
added as basic handlers.
.level = CONFIG --> the root logger should be specified with the CONFIG.
 
# default file output is in same directory.
java.util.logging.FileHandler.level = CONFIG
java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern = ./jdbc_trace.log
java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit = 10000000
java.util.logging.FileHandler.count = 1
java.util.logging.FileHandler.append = false
java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = Altibase.jdbc.driver.logging.SingleLineFormatter
 -->  This is a section in which configuring the default setting of java.util.logging.FileHandler. The level of FileHandler is specified with CONFIG since only the sql information is needed.

java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = CONFIG
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter = Altibase.jdbc.driver.logging.SingleLineFormatter
 -->  This is a section configuring java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler. SingleLineFormatter is used to print out logs in a line.
 
altibase.jdbc.level = CONFIG
altibase.jdbc.rowset.level = SEVERE
altibase.jdbc.cm.level = FINEST
altibase.jdbc.cm.handlers = Altibase.jdbc.driver.logging.MultipleFileHandler
#altibase.jdbc.cm.handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler
 --> This is a section in which altibase jdbc logger is configured, and the rowset level is specified with SEVERE since the record set information needs to be excluded. The Network packet information should be loged;thus, the cm level is specified with FINEST. Moreover, in terms of the network packet, MultipleFileHandler was used as a handler in order to store a file per each session. 
 
Altibase.jdbc.driver.logging.MultipleFileHandler.level = FINEST
Altibase.jdbc.driver.logging.MultipleFileHandler.pattern = ./jdbc_net_%s.log
Altibase.jdbc.driver.logging.MultipleFileHandler.limit = 10000000
Altibase.jdbc.driver.logging.MultipleFileHandler.count = 1
Altibase.jdbc.driver.logging.MultipleFileHandler.formatter = java.util.logging.XMLFormatter
--> By using jdbc_net_%s.log,it is configured that a file will be created per a session ID. Also, a log will be created in a XML formatter file by using XMLFormatter.

```
### Hibernate
Altibase provides nonstandard SQL while Hibernate facilitates such provision of Altibase as supporting Dialect class. In order to interlock Altibase, the Altibase JDBC Driver should be configured and AltibaseDialect.class should be specified as well into configuration under Hibernate.

#### AltibaseDialect
Since the library that Hibernate officially provides does not include AltibaseDialect.class, AltibaseDialect.java file(include AltibaseLimitHandler.java as occasion arises) should be compiled and ported to a file Hibernate provides so that it can be available for use. 

The AltibaseDialect.java file and the AltibaseLimitHandler.java file are Available from the Altibase Github site. For detailed instructions on how to port AltibaseDialect, refer to (https://github.com/ALTIBASE/hibernate-orm/blob/master/ALTIBASE_DIALECT_PORTING.md).

#### Checking Version
```
$ java -jar Altibase.jar
Altibase 7.2.0.0.0 with CMP 7.1.7 for JDBC 3.0 compiled with JDK 5(sharding included)
```
#### Connection Setting
##### DriverManager
Add a sharding prefix to the existing jdbc url.
```
String sUrl = "jdbc:sharding:Altibase://127.0.0.1:20300/mydb"
Connection sCon = DriverManager.getConnection( sUrl, sProps);
...
```
##### DataSource
Use AltibaseShardingDataSource that implements javax.sql.DataSource.
```
String sUrl = "jdbc:sharding:Altibase://127.0.0.1:20300/mydb";
AltibaseShardingDataSource sDataSource = new AltibaseShardingDataSource();
sDataSource.setURL(sUrl);
sDataSource.setUser("sys");
sDataSource.setPassword("manager");
Connection sCon = sDataSource.getConnection();
...
```
#### Connection Pool Setting
Connection pooling can be used to connect to the meta server. For connection pools, open source connection pools like DBCP, AltibaseShardingConnnectionPoolDataSource can be used, and the connection with the data node is not pooled because the driver itself is caching.

##### DBCP
dbcp can create a connection pool using DriverClassName as follows:
###### Simple JDBC
```
public DataSource createDataSourceNode(String aUrl)
{
    BasicDataSource sResult = new BasicDataSource();  // Apache DBCP Connection Pool DataSource
    sResult.setDriverClassName(Altibase.jdbc.driver.AltibaseDriver.class.getName());
    sResult.setUrl(aUrl);  // with shard prefix (ex : jdbc:sharding:Altibase://127.0.0.1:20300/mydb)
    sResult.setUsername("sys");
    sResult.setPassword("manager");
    return sResult;
}
```
###### Spring
```
<bean id="shardDataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource">
    <property name="driverClassName" value="Altibase.jdbc.driver.AltibaseDriver" />
    <property name="url" value="jdbc:sharding:Altibase://127.0.0.1:20300/mydb" />
    <property name="username" value="sys" />
    <property name="password" value="manager" />
    <property name="initialSize" value="3" />
    <property name="maxActive" value="10" />
</bean>
```
##### ConnectionPoolDataSource
shardjdbc provides AltibaseShardingConnectionPoolDataSource that implements javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource. Usage is the same as the existing AltibaseConnectionPoolDataSource and can be used in environments where open source connection pools are not available.

```
private Connection getConnection() throws SQLException
{
    String sURL = "jdbc:sharding:Altibase://127.0.0.1/mydb";
    AltibaseShardingConnectionPoolDataSource sDataSource = new AltibaseShardingConnectionPoolDataSource();
    sDataSource.setURL(sURL);
    PooledConnection sPooledConn = sDataSource.getPooledConnection("SYS", "MANAGER");
    return sPooledConn.getConnection();
}
```
#### Environment variables
The configuration of the thread pool to use can be read when running shard sql in parallel from environment variables.	

| Name                      | Description                                  |   Default   |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| SHARD_JDBC_POOL_CORE_SIZE | The number of threads to keep in the pool (including idle) | CPU cores |
| SHARD_JDBC_POOL_MAX_SIZE  | Maximum number of threads allowed in the pool |   128        |
| SHARD_JDBC_IDLE_TIMEOUT   | If there are more threads than the core size in the current pool, the excess threads will terminate when the idle time exceeds idle_timeout. |   10(minutes)    |

#### Logging
Logging related settings are also available as environment variables. By default, the SHARD_JDBC_TRCLOG_LEVEL environment variable can be set to INFO or SEVERE to log.

| Name                           | Description                                                  | Default |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| SHARD_JDBC_TRCLOG_LEVEL        | shardjdbc log level                                          | OFF     |
| SHARD_JDBC_TRCLOG_PRINT_STDERR | Whether to pass to the parent logger. <br/> If set to TRUE, logs are normally left in the console. | FALSE   |
##### Log Levels
```
Originally, JDK Logging can be set in the following order: SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST, but shardjdbc uses both SEVERE and INFO levels.
```

| Name   | Description                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| INFO   | Logging includes information about objects related to sharding. |
| SEVERE | Under normal circumstances, when there is no log and an exception is raised, the information of the corresponding exception is logged. |
##### Log File Paths
| Environment Variable   | Path                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| When ALTIBASE_HOME is in the environment variable | ${ALTIBASE_HOME}/trc/shardjdbc.trc      |
| When there is no ALTIBASE_HOME in the environment variable | Client execution path  |
##### Log File Rotate
The default log file is about 15 megabytes in size and rotates up to five if exceeded.

#### Failover
##### Application Guide
In the Altibase Sharding environment, there are transactions and connections running on multiple shard nodes, which are optimized and processed internally in the shard library or server. Thus, even in the event of a node failure or connection failure, some connections may remain or transactions may not be completely withdrawn.

In this distributed environment, the application must Fail-Over can be processed normally only by using NON-AUTOCOMMIT according to the following guide.

However, if the applicaiton program is designed not to access multiple shard nodes, the AUTOCOMMIT mode can be used, but even in this case, the service can be processed normally after fail-over only when it is processed according to the guide for AUTOCOMMIT.

##### CTF(Connection Time Failover)

In the case of a CTF, you will be able to know whether it is successful or not, depending on whether you have a database connection.

However, in the case of ShardJDBC, because the lazy method is the default, if a transaction has already started, even if a failure occurs due to a node error at the time of execution, CTF does not occur and STF is raised. In this case, CTF occurs in the AUTOCOMMIT situation. When the shard_lazy_connect property is false, it operates in the same way as ShardCLI.

Therefore, if the initial user connection creation fails, you do not have to disconnect the entire connection. You only need to retry the user connection.

##### STF(Service Time Failover)

In the case of ShardJDBC, if a ShardFailOverSuccessException exception occurs in prepare, execute, or fetch, the STF can be determined to be successful.

- NON-AUTOCOMMIT Transaction

When an exception occurs in ShardJDBC, error logic is processed in the following order.

1. If the STF succeeds (ShardFailOverSuccessException), the rollback is executed. If the rollback succeeds, the application returns to the transaction restart position and executes the application logic.
   1. The transaction restart position should be set before the initial prepare when using prepare and before execute when executing. At this time, the Bind does not need to be done again.
   2. If direct execute is used, can go back to before direct execute.
   3. Fail-over may occur again during rollback after successful STF. In this case, rollback is executed again.
2. If the STF fails and there are no more available nodes available  for service(ShardFailoverIsNotAvailableException), explicitly disconnect from all nodes and retry from the initial connection.
   1. In a sharding environment, many nodes are connected, so Connection.close () must be called explicitly to disconnect from all nodes.
3. For other errors, the application error handling logic is executed.

- AUTOCOMMIT Transaction

  When an exception occurs in ShardJDBC, error logic is processed in the following order.

1. If the STF succeeds (ShardFailOverSuccessException), it returns to the transaction restart position and executes the application logic.
   1. The transaction restart position should be set before the initial prepare when using prepare and before execute. At this time, the Bind does not need to be done again.
   2. If direct execute is used, can go back to before direct execute.
2. If the STF fails and there are no more available nodes available  for service(ShardFailoverIsNotAvailableException), explicitly disconnect from all nodes and retry from the initial connection.
   1. In a sharding environment, many nodes are connected, so Connection.close () must be called explicitly to disconnect from all nodes.

##### ShardJDBC Failover Sample Code

ShardJDBC sample code including failover of Altibase Sharding It is located in \$ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/SHARD/Fail-Over/FailoverSample.java, and this program is an example of application considering the fail-over written using ShardJDBC.

The code of FailoverSample.java assumes that the T1 table is registered as a shard table after creating the T1 table with the syntax “CREATE TABLE T1 (I1 VARCHAR (20), I2 INTEGER);”.

The program receives and connects the port and alternate port of the shard node to be connected for the first time and executes the application logic to input one data by the direct-execute method, execute the query by the prepare-execute method, and then output the retrieved data. 

If there is a failure of a specific node while executing the example program, an error does not occur during the initial connection, but during execution, it fails over through the STF.

Note that in order to retry a connection, Connection.close () must be called to close any remaining connections, and when error occurs, check for possible eorros on multiple nodes. In order to do this. all nodes must be checked for erorrs with SQLException.getNetExeception ().

When Service Time Fail-over occurs through error checking, call Connection.rollback () to clean up the remaining transactions in the shard node that has not been closed, and then return to prepare or execute logic again.

Fore detailed code information, refer to \$ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/SHARD/Fail-Over/FailoverSample.java.

      * getXAConnection(String user, String password)

## 4. Tips & Recommendation

This chapter shows how to use Altibase JDBC driver efficiently.

### Tips for Better Performance

The following tips should be kept in mind to enhance the performance of JDBC applications.

-   It is recommended to use the Stream or Writer object when using LOB data in JDBC applications. If the size of the LOB data to be used is equal to or smaller than 8192 bytes, the Lob_Cache_Threshhold connection attribute must be set to an appropriate value. 
-   It is recommended to execute one operation on one Connection object. For example, if a multiple number of Statement objects are created in one Connection object and their operations are executed, this can induce performance loss. 
-   It is recommended to use the Connection Pool provided by Middleware (WAS) when the Connection object is frequently created and deleted. This is because the cost of connecting and terminating a Connection is relatively higher than other operations. 

5. Error Messages
-----------

This chapter lists the SQL States of errors which can occur while using the Altibase JDBC driver.

### SQL States

The string value returned to SQLSTATE is composed of the first 2 characters which indicate the class and the following 3 characters which indicate the subclass. The class indicates the state and the subclass indicates the detailed state.

The following table lists the types of SQLSTATE which can occur in the Altibase JDBC driver and its meanings briefly.
