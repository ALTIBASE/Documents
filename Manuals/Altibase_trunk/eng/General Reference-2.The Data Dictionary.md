## 3. The Data Dictionary

The data dictionary of Altibase consists of meta tables, in which information about objects is stored, and process tables, in which information about processes is stored. Process tables comprise fixed tables and performance views. 

This chapter describes the Altibase data dictionary, which is the basis of all database objects and all Altibase system information.

### Meta Tables

Meta tables are system-defined tables that contain all information about database objects. 

This section describes the types of meta tables and their structure, and explains how to read and update the information in meta tables.

#### Structure and Function

Meta tables are defined by the system for the purpose of managing database objects. They use the same data types and store records in the same way as user-defined tables. When Altibase starts up, it loads information about database objects. When DDL statements are executed, meta tables are used to read, store, and update this information. The owner of meta tables is the system user (user name: SYSTEM_), so normal users have limited access to meta tables. 

#### Retrieving Information from Meta Tables

When a database object is created, deleted or modified using a DDL statement, the system creates, deletes, or updates records in one or more meta tables. 

After a DDL statement is executed, the resultant changes to database objects can be confirmed by checking meta tables. This is accomplished using a SELECT statement, just as with a regular database table. 

#### Modifying Data in Meta Tables

It is possible to use DML statements to explicitly make changes to the data in meta tables. However, the system-defined system user (SYSTEM_) can only make such changes to meta tables. Additionally, when the information in meta tables is changed, the system may become impossible to start, information about database objects may be lost, or the system may be critically damaged. Therefore, users must avoid making changes to meta tables whenever possible. When it is inevitable that a user must change meta table information, it is imperative that the database first be backed up, and it must be understood that the user is completely responsible for any damage resulting from making direct changes to meta table information.

#### Modifying Meta Table Schema

The meta table schema may be modified when a new kind of DDL statement is introduced, or when the functionality of an existing statement is changed. Depending on the characteristics of the changes to meta table schema, one of two cases may arise: either the database might need to be migrated, or the meta table schema will simply be automatically modified when Altibase is restarted. This should be kept in mind when upgrading Altibase to a newer version.

#### The types of Meta Tables

For more information about data types, please refer to Chapter1: Data Types.

##### LANG_ID

A column that contains the language properties for character data types (CHAR, VARCHAR).

##### OFFSET

This indicates the physical starting point of a column within a record. The offset and size of a column are used to calculate the physical storage size of a record.

##### SIZE

This is the physical storage size of the column in a record, calculated by the system based on the column type, user-defined precision, etc.

##### USER_ID

This corresponds to a USER_ID value in the SYS_USERS_ meta table, and identifies the owner of the table to which the column belongs.

##### TABLE_ID

This corresponds to a TABLE_ID value in the SYS_TABLES_ meta table, and identifies the table to which the column belongs.

##### PRECISION

This is the precision of the data type, and is either defined by the user or corresponds to the default value for the system. In the case of a character data type, it corresponds to the length of the character data type set by the user.

##### SCALE

This is the scale of the data type, and is either defined by the user or corresponds to the default value for the system. This value is not used with some data types. 

##### COLUMN_ORDER

This is the order in which columns appear in a table. 

The order in which the columns are stated in a CREATE TABLE statement determines the order in which they are created, and thus their position in the table. If a column is added using an ALTER TABLE statement, the newly created column will be the last column in the table.

##### COLUMN_NAME

This is the name specified when a user creates a table or adds a column to the table.

##### IS_NULLABLE

Indicates whether NULL is allowed in the column.

When creating a column, the user can explicitly specify whether to allow NULL for the column. If not specified, NULL is allowed by default.

##### DEFAULT_VAL

The default value the user specified in the column is displayed.

If the column is a hidden column added automatically due to the creation of a function-based index, the formula used to create the function-based index is stored.

##### STORE_TYPE

When physically storing a column, it can either be written as part of a record, or it can be saved on another page, in which case only the location of the data is stored in the record. 

If the physical storage size of a column is too big, or if the size of the column varies frequently for individual records, the column can be stored on another page by using the VARIABLE option when defining the column. This option is generally used for VARCHAR types where the character strings in a column are long. 

This column indicates whether the VARIABLE option is used.

##### IN_ROW_SIZE

This is the default IN_ROW_SIZE when data are stored in variable-length columns in memory tables. When data are inserted into a variable-length column, if the length of the data is equal to or smaller than the value specified by IN_ROW_SIZE, the data are stored in the fixed space, whereas if the data are longer than this value, they are stored in a variable space. For disk tables, this value is always 0. 

For more information about variable-length columns and the IN ROW clause, please refer to Chapter1: Data Types.

##### IS_HIDDEN

This indicates whether the column has hidden properties or not. On the creation of function-based indexes, columns with hidden properties are automatically added to the table. One of the following two values is displayed in this column:

- T: Hidden column
- F: Public column

##### IS_KEY_PRESERVED

This indicates whether the column of the join view is modifiable with DML statements(INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). For columns of regular tables, this value is specified as 'T'; for views, this value is specified as 'T' for modifiable columns, and 'F' for unmodifiable columns.

- T: Modifiable columns
- F: Unmodifiable columns

#### Column Information

##### USER_ID

This is the identifier of the owner of the table, and corresponds to a USER_ID in the SYS_USERS_ meta table

##### TABLE_ID

This is the table identifier, which is automatically assigned by the system sequence.

##### TABLE_OID

This is the table object identifier, which is automatically and internally assigned by the system. Unlike TABLE_ID, which is used when the user reads meta tables, this value is used only for internal operations.

##### COLUMN_COUNT

This is the number of columns defined in the table.

##### TABLE_NAME

This is the table name, which is defined by the user.

##### TABLE_TYPE

Information not only about tables, but also about sequences, views, etc. is saved in the SYS_TABLES_ meta table. This type identifier is used to distinguish them, and consists of the following types:

- T: A table
- S: A sequence
- V: A view
- W: A sequence for queue use only
- Q: A queue
- M: A table automatically created for the maintenance of the data of the materialized view
- A: A view automatically created for the maintenance of the data of the materialized view
- G: An internal table for global index of
- D: A dictionary table internally used for actually storing compressed column data

##### REPLICATION_COUNT

This is the number of replication objects associated with the table.

##### TBS_ID

This is the identifier of the tablespace in which the table is saved.

##### PCTFREE

This is the minimum percentage of free space that must exist in order for it to be possible to update a page. Usually, an amount of space equal to the percentage specified in PCTFREE is kept free so that existing rows saved in a page can be updated. For example, if PCTFREE is set to 20, 20% of the space in the page is set aside for update operations, so data can be inserted only into 80% of the space in the page.

The user can set PCTFREE between 0 and 99 when executing the CREATE TABLE statement. 

##### PCTUSED

This is a threshold below which the amount of used space in a page must decrease in order for the page to return to the state in which records can be inserted from the state in which only update operations are possible. If the amount of free space falls below the percentage specified in PCTFREE, it will become impossible to insert new records into the page, and it will only be possible to update and delete rows. If subsequent update or delete operations reduce the percentage of used space below the threshold specified by PCTUSED, it will become possible to insert new rows into the page again.

The user can set PCTUSED between 0 and 99 when the CREATE TABLE statement is executed.

> \* For more detailed explanations of PCTFREE and PCTUSED, please refer to the description of the CREATE TABLE statement in the *SQL Reference*.

##### INIT_TRANS

This is the initial number of update transactions that can be simultaneously executed, and is set when a page is created. The actual number of transactions can increase to the number specified in MAX_TRANS, as long as sufficient page space is available.

##### MAX_TRANS

This is the maximum number of update transactions that can be simultaneously executed for a single page.

##### INITEXTENTS

This denotes the number of extents that are available to be allocated when a table is created.

##### NEXTEXTENTS

This denotes the number of additional extents that are available to be allocated when the size of a table is increased.

##### MINEXTENTS

This denotes the minimum number of available extents for a table.

##### MAXEXTENTS

This denotes the maximum number of available extents for a table. 

##### IS_PARTITIONED

##### TEMPORARY

This indicates whether or not the table is a temporary table. 

- D: A transaction-specific temporary table
- P: A session-specific temporary table
- N: Not a temporary table

##### HIDDEN

- Y: The table is hidden from the user
- N: the table is open to the user (normal table)

##### PARALLEL_DEGREE

This indicates the number of threads which execute parallel queries when scanning the partitioned table. 

##### ACCESS

This is the data access mode for the table. The default mode is W which allows Read/Write.

- R: Read-Only mode
- W: Read/Write mode (default mode)
- A: Read/Add mode. This mode disallows the alteration/deletion of data.

### Performance Views

Performance views are structures that exist in memory but have the form of regular tables, and allow users to monitor internal information about an Altibase system, such as system memory, process status, sessions, buffers, threads, etc. 

Performance views allow Altibase users to easily obtain information about memory objects (e.g. session information, log information, thread information) using SQL statements while Altibase is running, in the same way that they would use SQL to search for data saved in regular tables. 

This section describes the kinds of performance views provided with Altibase, their structure and function, how to access them, and the information that each view provides.

#### Structures and Features

Inside Altibase there is not only information about user-created objects such as tables; there is also a variety of information required for the operation of the DBMS itself. Because Altibase has a hybrid structure, in which tables can be created and queried not only in memory space but also in disk space, monitoring Altibase is particularly critical. 

Performance views provide information about most of the internal memory structures used by Altibase processes in the form of views. Because the data is dynamically created in real time when a view is queried, users can always obtain up-to-date information about internal processes. 

Performance views are always read-only. If a user attempts to modify the data in a performance view, Altibase returns an error and rolls back the transaction. 

#### How to Use Performance Views

The entire list of performance views can be retrieved in iSQL as follows: 

```
iSQL> SELECT * FROM V$TAB;
```

Performance view schemas can be checked from iSQL using the DESC command, just as with regular tables, and SELECT statements can also be used to query data in the same way that they would be used to query regular tables

#### V$Views

Performance views are identified by the prefix V$. The following table lists all performance views.

#### Column Information

##### ID

This is a unique buffer pool number. Its value is 0 because multiple buffer pools are not currently supported. 

##### POOL_SIZE

This is the number of pages in the buffer pool. POOL_SIZE * PAGE_SIZE is equal to the size specified by the BUFFER_AREA_SIZE property.

##### PAGE_SIZE

This is the size of the pages used in the buffer pool at present. Only the fixed value 8192 is possible, because multiple buffer pools are not currently supported. 

##### HASH_BUCKET_COUNT

This is the number of hash table buckets. It is determined by the BUFFER_HASH_BUCKET_DENSITY property. This value cannot be changed while the server is running. The greater this value is, the less expensive it is to search the hash bucket list.

##### HASH_CHAIN_LATCH_COUNT

This is the number of chain latches used in the hash table. The greater this value is, the less competition there is for latches, which can occur when searching the hash table.

##### LRU_LIST_COUNT

This is the number of LRU lists in the buffer pool. 

##### PREPARE_LIST_COUNT

This is the number of prepare lists in the buffer pool.

##### FLUSH_LIST_COUNT

This is the number of flush lists in the buffer pool.

##### CHECKPOINT_LIST_COUNT

This is the number of flush lists in the buffer pool.

##### VICTIM_SEARCH_COUNT

This is the maximum number of BCBs that are searched when searching for replacement targets in LRU lists. If the search for replacement targets reaches the specified value and no replacement target is found, Buffer Manager waits until the flusher adds a clean buffer to the prepare list.

##### HASH_PAGES

This is the number of buffers that have been inserted into the hash table. lts value indicates the number of buffers currently in use. 

##### HOT_LIST_PAGES

This is the number of buffers that exist on the LRU hot list. 

##### COLD_LIST_PAGES

This is the number of buffers that exist on the LRU cold list.

##### PREPARE_LIST_PAGES

This is the number of buffers that exist on the prepare list. If the value is 0, the LRU list is searched in order to obtain replacement targets.

##### FLUSH_LIST_PAGES

This is the number of buffers that exist on the flush list. A high value means that there are many buffers to be flushed. 

##### CHECKPOINT_LIST_PAGES

This is the number of buffers that exist on the checkpoint list. It also indicates the number of pages that have been renewed. 

##### FIX_PAGES

This is the cumulative number of pages that have been requested without obtaining latches since the system was started.

##### GET_PAGES

This is the cumulative number of page latches that have been have been requested and obtained since the system was started.

##### READ_PAGES

This is the cumulative number of pages that have been read from disk when requesting a page. It also indicates the number of buffer misses.

##### CREATE_PAGES

This is the cumulative number of page assignments for the insertion of data into new pages. Page creation isn't actually accompanied by disk I/O.

##### HIT_RATIO

This is the cumulative hit ratio in the buffer pool. It can be calculated thus: (GET_PAGES + FIX_PAGES - READ_PAGES)/(GET_PAGES + FIX_PAGES). If this value is low, it means that many pages have been read from disk instead of from the cache. In other words, if the value is low, the system will not be able to process queries quickly.

##### HOT_HITS

This is the cumulative number of hits on the LRU hot list. If a requested page is already in the buffer, a hit doesn't cause a page to be read.

##### COLD_HITS

This is the cumulative number of hits on the LRU cold list.

##### PREPARE_HITS

This is the cumulative number of hits on the prepare list. 

##### FLUSH_HITS

This is the cumulative number of hits on the flush list.

##### OTHER_HITS

This is the number of hits on a buffer that was not on any list at that moment. A hit buffer need not always be on a list.

##### PREPARE_VICTIMS

This is the cumulative number of searches for replacement buffers on a prepare list. 

##### LRU_VICTIMS

This is the cumulative number of searches for replacement buffers on an LRU list.

##### VICTIM_FAILS

This is the cumulative number of failures to find a replacement target buffer. This value can be calculated thus: PREPARE_AGAIN_VICTIMS + VICTIM_SEARCH_WARP. 

Summing PREPARE_VICTIMS + LRU_VICTIMS + VICTIM_FAILS gives the total number of replacements in the buffer pool.

##### PREPARE_AGAIN_VICTIMS

After failing to find replacement target buffers, it is necessary to wait for the insertion of buffers on a prepare list. While waiting, this is the number of clean buffers that have been received and selected as replacement targets.

##### VICTIM_SEARCH_WARP

This is the cumulative number of searches for replacement target buffers that failed after the specified period of time and thus passed to the next prepare list.

##### LRU_SEARCHS

This is the cumulative number of buffers for which searches for replacement target buffers have been made in the LRU list.

##### LRU_SEARCHS_AVG

This is the average number of buffers that are searched when searching for a replacement target.

##### LRU_TO_HOTS

This is the cumulative number of times that buffers have moved into hot areas in LRU lists.

##### LRU_TO_COLDS

This is the cumulative number of times that buffers have moved into cold areas in LRU lists.

##### LRU_TO_FLUSHS

This is the cumulative number of times that buffers have moved from LRU lists to flush lists. 

##### HOT_INSERTIONS

This is the cumulative number of insertions into LRU hot lists.

##### COLD_INSERTIONS

This is the cumulative number of insertions into LRU cold lists. 

##### DB_SINGLE_READ_PERF

When FETCH, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operations are performed on disk tables, one data page is read from a data file on disk and stored in a memory buffer. This is the average number of bytes that are read from disk per second (in kB/sec) in the course of such tasks.

##### DB_MULTI_READ_PERF

When a so-called "full scan" is performed, i.e. when an entire disk table is scanned, multiple data pages are simultaneously read from a data file on disk and stored in a memory buffer. This is the average number of bytes that are read from disk per second (in kB/sec) in the course of this task.

#### Column Information

##### ODBC_DATA_TYPE

This is the data type identifier for the ODBC SQL data type corresponding to the data type. For more information, please refer to the appendix pertaining to data types in the *ODBC Reference*. 

##### COLUMN_SIZE

This is the maximum column size for the data type. 

For numeric data types, this is the precision value, which was specified when the type was defined. For string data types, this is the length value, which was specified when the type was defined. For datetime data types, this is the total number of characters that are needed to display a value when it is converted to characters. 

##### LITERAL_PREFIX

This specifies the characters that signify the prefix of a literal for the data type. For data types to which literal prefixes do not apply, it is NULL.

##### LITERAL_SUFFIX

This specifies the characters that signify the suffix of a literal for the data type. For data types to which literal suffixes do not apply, it is NULL.

##### CREATE_PARAM

When using SQL to define a data type, this is a comma-separated list of parameter keywords enclosed in parentheses. For example, to express a NUMBER as NUMBER(precision,scale), the content within the parentheses, that is, “precision, scale”, is the list. ”Precision” and “scale” are thus both keywords in the list. For data types that do not need parameters, this is set to NULL. 

##### NULLABLE

This indicates whether NULL values are allowed for a data type. 

- 1: NULL is allowed.
- 0: NULL is not allowed. 

##### CASE_SENSITIVE

For character data types, indicates whether to distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letters when sorting data of the data type. 

- 1: Case-sensitive. 
- 0: Not case-sensitive.

##### SEARCHABLE

Indicates how a data type can be used in a WHERE clause.

- 0: It cannot be used in a WHERE clause (SQL_PRED_NONE). 
- 1: It can be used in a WHERE clause, but must be used with LIKE (SQL_PRED_CHAR). 
- 2: It can be used in a WHERE clause with any comparison operator except LIKE (SQL_PRED_BASIC). 
- 3: It can be used in a WHERE clause with any comparison operator (SQL_SEARCHABLE).

##### UNSIGNED_ATTRIBUTE

Indicates whether a data type is signed.

- 1: The data type is an unsigned data type.
- 0: The data type is a signed data type.
- NULL: The data type is not numeric, therefore this attribute is not applicable.

##### LOCAL_TYPE_NAME

Indicates a localized (region-specific) name for a data type. If there is no localized name, this value is NULL. 

##### MINIMUM_SCALE

For numeric data types, this is the minimum allowable number of digits to the right of the decimal. This value exists for fixed scale types; it is set to NULL for types to which scale does not pertain

##### MAXIMUM_SCALE

##### TOTAL_DW_USEC

This is the cumulative amount of time taken to write the contents of doublewrite buffers to disk. In so-called “doublewrite”, pages are first written to DW (“doublewrite”) files, i.e. the disk-resident doublewrite buffer. Once this process is complete, the pages are then written to data files in the usual location. If the operating system crashes during the process of writing pages to data files, or if these data files become corrupted, it will be possible to perform data recovery using the uncorrupted copies of the pages in the doublewrite buffer.

##### TOTAL_WRITE_USEC

This is the cumulative amount of time taken to write data pages to data files. This value does not include the amount of time spent flushing data to disk.

##### TOTAL_SYNC_USEC

This is the cumulative amount of time spent forcibly flushing data to disk.

##### TOTAL_FLUSH_TEMP_PAGES

##### TOTAL_TEMP_WRITE_USEC

This is the amount of time spent writing temporary pages to temporary files.

##### TOTAL_CALC_CHECKSUM_USEC

This is the amount of time taken to calculate checksums, which are used to determine whether pages are corrupt.

### V\$LOCK_WAIT

This view shows wait information between transactions that are executed on the system.

| Column name       | Type   | Description                                        |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| TRANS_ID          | BIGINT | The identifier of the waiting transaction          |
| WAIT_FOR_TRANS_ID | BIGINT | The identifier of the transaction being waited for |

#### Column Information

##### TRANS_ID

This is the identifier of the transaction that is currently waiting.

##### WAIT_FOR_TRANS_ID

This is the identifier of the transaction for which the transaction identified by TRANS_ID is waiting.

```
SQL> select * from v$lock_wait;
V$LOCK_WAIT.TRANS_ID  V$LOCK_WAIT.WAIT_FOR_TRANS_ID 
---------------------------------------------
1216                          2208                 
5344                         2208                 
2 rows selected.	
```

In the above example, transactions 1216 and 5344 are waiting for transaction 2208. 

### V\$MEMGC

This view displays memory space recovery (that is, memory garbage collection) information.

| Column name             | Type         | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| AGING_PROCESSED_OID_CNT | BIGINT       | The number of outdated versions of records that have been deleted |
| THREAD_COUNT            | INTEGER      | The number of garbage collection threads                     |

#### Column Information

Because Altibase supports MVCC, multiple versions of a single record can exist. In other words, one record consists of a most recent version and a number of previous versions. For more detailed information on MVCC, please refer to the sections pertaining to Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) in both the *Altibase* *Administrator’s Manual* and the *Altibase Getting Started Guide*.

##### AGING_REQUEST_OID_CNT

If 10 records are deleted in one transaction, which is then committed, there are now 10 outdated records that can be cleared to recover space. However, because ADD_OID_CNT is determined on the basis of transactions, it is incremented by 1. To remedy this, AGING_REQUEST_OID_CNT, which is determined on the basis of OIDs, is incremented by 10.

##### AGING_PROCESSED_OID_CNT

If the garbage collector (or ager) deletes 10 outdated versions of records from the same OID list, GC_OID_CNT is only incremented by 1 because it determined on the basis of lists. To remedy this, AGING_PROCESSED_OID_CNT, which is determined on the basis of OIDs, is incremented by 10. 

##### THREAD_COUNT

This shows the number of garbage collection threads.

### V\$MEMSTAT

This view displays statistics about the memory being used by Altibase processes.

| Column name    | Type     | Description                                              |

This indicates the order in which characters are compared according to how they appear in a dictionary of the language corresponding to the character set that was specified when the database was created. At present, this is useful only when Korean (KSC-5601 Completion or MS Extended Completion) is specified as the database character set.

##### NLS_NCHAR_CONV_EXCP

This shows how errors are handled when the character set is converted.

##### NLS_NCHAR_LITERAL_REPLACE

This shows whether the client will check whether NCHAR literals exist within a SQL statement. If this is TRUE, the client always checks whether NCHAR literals exist, and convert the remainder of the SQL statement, other than the NCHAR literals, to the database character set. If this is FALSE, the client doesn't check this, and convert the entire SQL statement to to the database character set.

In other words, this is the gap between the log record that was most recently written by a transaction on the local server and the log record that is currently being sent by the replication Sender thread.

##### REP_GAP_SIZE

This is the log file size of the replication gap, in bytes.

##### READ_FILE_NO

This indicates the number of the log file that is currently being read.

A thread in server process that receives and fulfills request(queries) from clients is called a service thread. Altibase provides the following two modes for the creation of service threads:

-   Dedicated Thread Mode:  
    When a multiple number of clients connect to the server and execute queries, one service thread is created for each client session in order to execute queries.
    
-   Multiplexing Thread Mode:  
    The Altibase server creates only the number of service threads optimized for the server and client sessions share these. 

Altibase is designed to always maintain the optimal number of service threads by dynamically adding or deleting service threads as needed; however, the minimum number of service threads specified in the DEDICATED_THREAD_INIT_COUNT or MULTIPLEXING_THREAD_COUNT property is maintained.

#### Column Information

##### ID

This is the identifier of the service thread. This is an identifier that is managed within Altibase, rather than a system thread identifier (that is, a Light Weight Process ID).

##### TYPE

This shows the service thread connection method. It can have the following values:

-   SOCKET (MULTIPLEXING): Connection via TCP or Unix Domain (UDP) 
-   SOCKET (DEDICATED): Connection via TCP or Unix Domain Socket 
-   IPC: Connection via IPC 
-   IPCDA: Connection via IPCDA

##### STATE

This indicates the current status of the service thread. It can have the following values:

-   NONE: The service thread is being initialized. 
-   POLL: The service thread is waiting for an event. 
-   QUEUE-WAIT: The service thread is waiting in the queue. 
-   EXECUTE: The service thread is executing a statement. 
-   UNKNOWN: The status of the service thread cannot be determined.

##### RUN_MODE

This shows the mode of execution of the service thread. It can be either SHARED or DEDICATED.

-   SHARED: The service thread run in multiplexing mode, and one service thread serves multiple client connections.

-   DEDICATED: One client connection is allocated to one service thread, and uses the thread exclusively.

Switching the operating mode of a service thread is currently possible only for queue-related tasks. The mode can only be switched from SHARED mode to DEDICATED mode.

##### STATEMENT_ID

This is the identifier of the SQL statement that is currently being executed by the service thread.

##### START_TIME

This is the time point at which the service thread was created. It is based on system time. (Unit: seconds)

##### EXECUTE_TIME

This is the amount of time that the service thread has taken to execute the current query. (Unit: microseconds)

##### TASK_COUNT

This is the total number of sessions that are assigned to the service thread.

##### READY_TASK_COUNT

This is the number of sessions that are waiting for their requests to be processed by service threads

#### Column Information

##### ID

This is a number for classifying the transaction, ranging from 0 to 2^32 – 1. These values can be reused.

##### SESSION_ID

This is the identifier of the session in which the transaction is executing. If no session is associated with the transaction, this value is -1, which indicates that the transaction branch is in a prepared state in an XA environment.

##### MEMORY_VIEW_SCN

Because Altibase uses MVCC, it has an SCN that indicates the relative point in time at which each cursor for a table was opened. This value is the smallest value of the View SCNs for memory table cursors for the transaction. A value of 2^63 means that no cursor is open.

##### MIN_MEMORY_LOB_VIEW_SCN

This is the SCN of the oldest of the currently open disk LOB cursors for the present transaction. A value of 2^63 means that no cursors are open.

##### DISK_VIEW_SCN

This is the lowest of the View SCN values for cursors that are currently open for disk tables for the present transaction. The range of values is the same as for MEMORY_VIEW_SCN.

##### MIN_DISK_LOB_VIEW_SCN

This is the SCN of the oldest of the currently open disk LOB cursors for the present transaction. A value of 2^63 means that no cursors are open.

##### COMMIT_SCN

This is the system SCN at the point in time at which the transaction is committed. A value of 263 means that the transaction has not been committed yet.

##### STATUS

This is the status of the current transaction. The possible values are:

-   1: PRECOMMIT

-   2: COMMIT_IN_MEMORY

-   3: COMMIT

##### UPDATE_STATUS

This indicates whether the transaction is a transaction that is still updating or a read-only transaction.

-   0: read-only

-   1: updating

##### LOG_TYPE

This indicates whether the transaction updates tables related to replication. The possible values are:

-   0: General

-   1: Replication-related

##### XA_COMMIT_STATUS

This is the status of a local transaction that is caused by a global transaction. It can have the following values:

-   1: PREPARED

-   2: COMPLETE

##### XA_PREPARED_TIME

This is the point in time at which a PREPARE command was received from the global transaction manager as the result of a global transaction.

##### FIRST_UNDO_NEXT_LSN_FILENO

This is the file number portion of the LSN, which indicates the location of the first log recorded for the transaction.

##### FIRST_UNDO_NEXT_LSN_OFFSET

This is the offset portion of the LSN, which indicates the location of the first log recorded for the transaction. The offset indicates the location of the log within a file.

##### LAST_UNDO_NEXT_LSN_FILENO

This is the file number portion of the LSN, which indicates the location of the last log recorded for the transaction.

##### LAST_UNDO_NEXT_LSN_OFFSET

This is the offset portion of the LSN, which indicates the location of the last log recorded for the transaction. The offset indicates the location of the log within a file.

##### LAST_UNDO_NEXT_SN

This is the sequence number (SN) of the last log recorded for the transaction.

##### SLOT_NO

This is the location of the transaction object in the transaction pool.

##### UPDATE_SIZE

This is the size of the data created as the result of an UPDATE operation executed by the transaction. If this value is greater than the value of the LOCK_ESCALATION_MEMORY_SIZE property, the table is locked with an X-lock and updates are performed according to the in-place update method.

##### FIRST_UPDATE_TIME

This is the point in time at which the database was first updated.

##### DDL_FLAG

This indicates whether the transaction is one that executes a DLL statement:

-   0: non-DDL

-   1: DDL

##### TSS_RID

This is the physical location of the Transaction Status Slot (TSL), which is obtained in order to perform an UPDATE operation on a disk table. A nonzero value means that the transaction has executed at least one update operation on a disk table.

##### ISOLATION_LEVEL

This is the isolation level of transaction.

### V\$USAGE

This view outputs information about the amount of space used by all of the tables and indexes that exist in the database. In order for the information presented in this view to be correct, it is first necessary to execute the built-in DBMS Stat stored procedures to gather statistical information.

For a detailed explanation of the built-in DBMS Stat stored procedures, please refer to the *Stored Procedures Manual*.

| Column name   | Type    | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TYPE          | CHAR(1) | The type of the object                                       |
| TARGET_ID     | BIGINT  | An identifier for the object                                 |
| META_SPACE    | BIGINT  | The amount of space occupied by meta information about the object |
| USED_SPACE    | BIGINT  | The amount of space occupied by the actual data in the object |
| AGEABLE_SPACE | BIGINT  | The amount of space occupied by outdated data that must be retained for concurrency control |
| FREE_SPACE    | BIGINT  | The amount of free space in the object                       |

#### Column Information

##### TYPE

This indicates the type of object. The value is "T" for a table and "I" for an index.

##### TARGET_ID

This is an identifier for the object. For a table, it is TABLE_OID (the table object identifier), whereas for an index it is INDEX_ID. To output the name of the object, use this column to join this table to the SYSTEM_.SYS_TABLES_ meta table using the TABLE_OID column, or to the SYSTEM_.SYS_INDICES_ meta table using the INDEX_ID column.

##### META_SPACE

This is the amount of space used to store the meta information for the object.

##### USED_SPACE

This is the amount of space used to store the actual data contained by the object.

##### AGEABLE_SPACE

Because MVCC is implemented in Altibase, even after data has already been deleted from a table or an index, previous versions of data are maintained for a short time in order to support concurrency control. This column indicates the amount of space occupied by such data.

##### FREE_SPACE

This is the amount of space in the object that has either never been used, or that was used but has since been freed and can be reused.

#### Example

```
iSQL> exec gather_database_stats();
SYSTEM_.SYS_TABLES_
SYSTEM_.SYS_COLUMNS_
SYSTEM_.SYS_DATABASE_
SYSTEM_.SYS_USERS_
SYSTEM_.SYS_DN_USERS_
SYSTEM_.SYS_TBS_USERS_
SYSTEM_.SYS_INDICES_
SYSTEM_.SYS_INDEX_COLUMNS_
...

### V\$XID

This view displays a list of XIDs, which are identifiers for distributed transactions in the DBMS. In compliance with XA, the distributed transaction identifier is generated internally by the TM (Transaction Manager) and sent to the RM (Resource Manager), that is, to other database nodes, when a distributed transaction commences.

| Column name      | Type         | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| XID_VALUE        | VARCHAR(256) | This returns the XID value as a character string             |
| ASSOC_SESSION_ID | INTEGER      | The identifier of the session connected to the XID object    |
| TRANS_ID         | INTEGER      | The identifier of the distributed transaction within the XID object |
| STATE            | VARCHAR(24)  | The state of the XID object                                  |
| STATE_START_TIME | INTEGER      | The time at which the state of the XID object was determined |
| STATE_DURATION   | BIGINT       | The amount of time that has elapsed since the state of the XID was determined |
| TX_BEGIN_FLAG    | VARCHAR(9)   | A flag within the XID object indicating whether the transaction has begun |
| REF_COUNT        | INTEGER      | The number of current references to the XID object           |

#### Column Information

##### XID_VALUE

This is the XID value, expressed as a character string. 

##### ASSOC_SESSION_ID

This is the identifier of the session related to the XID object, that is, the session which executed XA_START for this XID

##### TRANS_ID

This is the internal identifier of the distributed transaction within the XID object.

##### STATE

This is the state of execution of the XID object. The possible values for this state are as follows:

-   IDLE: This means that no sessions are connected to the XID. 
-   ACTIVE: This means that there is a session connected to the XID. In other words, XA_START has been executed for this XID. 
-   PREPARED: This means that a Prepare command has been received for a 2PC (Phase Commit) task. 
-   HEURISTICALLY_COMMITED: This means that the DBMS has forcefully committed the transaction branch of the XID. 
-   HEURISTICALLY_ROLLBACKED: This means that the DBMS has forcefully rolled back the transaction branch of the XID. 
-   NO_TX: This means that the XID has just been initialized, or that the transaction branch related to the XID has been committed or rolled back.

##### STATE_START_TIME

This is the time at which the state of the XID object was determined. 

##### STATE_DURATION

This is the amount of time that has elapsed since the state of the XID object was determined. 

##### TX_BEGIN_FLAG

This is an internal flag within the XID object that indicates whether the transaction branch has been started in the RM.

-   BEGIN: The transaction has started 

-   NOT BEGIN: The transaction has not started 

##### REF_COUNT

This is the number of current references to the XID object.
