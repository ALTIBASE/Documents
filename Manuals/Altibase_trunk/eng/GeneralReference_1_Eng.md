This manual describes command syntax using diagrams composed of the following elements:

| Elements                                                   | Meaning                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![](media/GeneralReference/GeneralReference_eng.1.2.1.jpg) | Indicates the start of a command. If a syntactic element starts with an arrow, it is not a complete command. |
| ![](media/GeneralReference/image006.gif)                   | Indicates that the command continues to the next line. if a syntactic element ends with this symbol, it is not a complete command. |
| ![](media/GeneralReference/image008.gif)                   | Indicates that the command continues from the previous line. If a syntactic element starts with this symbol, it is not a complete command. |
| ![](media/GeneralReference/image010.gif)                   | Indicates the end of a statement.                            |

| ![](media/GeneralReference/image020.gif)                   | Indicates an optional element in which multiple elements may be specified. A comma must precede all but the first element. |

##### Sample Code Conventions

The code examples explain SQL, stored procedures, iSQL, and other command line syntax.

The following describes the conventions used in the code examples:

| Rules            | Meaning                                                      | Example                                                      |

## 1. Data Types

In order to use SQL to store, change, and query the data in a database, it is first necessary to possess a thorough understanding of the available data types. This chapter presents a detailed explanation of the data types supported in Altibase.

### Overview

#### Data Type Overview

The following data types are supported in Altibase:

##### Character Data Types

<table>
    <tr>
    	<td colspan="3">M: Defined column length<br/>L: The length of the input string
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<th>Type</th>
        <th>Length</th>
        <th>Size</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>CHAR(M)</td>
        <td>1 ~ 32000</td>
        <td>M + 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>VARCHAR(M)</td>
        <td>1 ~ 32000</td>
        <td>length + 2, where
length = L if the input value is stored in a variable area
length = M if the input value is stored in a fixed area
</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
    	<td>NCHAR(M)</td>
        <td>1~16000(UTF16)
1~10666(UTF8)
</td>
        <td>M*2 + 2(UTF16)
M*3 + 2(UTF8)
</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
    	<td>NVARCHAR(M)</td>
        <td>1~16000(UTF16)
1~10666(UTF8)
</td>
        <td>length*2 + 2(UTF16)
length*2 + 2(UTF16)
length*3 + 2(UTF8)
where:
length = L if the input value is stored in a variable area
length = M if the input value is stored in a fixed area
</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

NCHAR and NVARCHAR are Unicode character types. The available maximum length of a UTF16-encoded string is different from that of a UTF8-encoded string.

</table>

###### Example 1

Fixed-Point Numbers Size Calculation: 

( 3 + ( ( p ) + 2 ) / 2 )

```
- NUMERIC  
  NUMERIC(38, 0): Size = 3 + 40/2 = 23 bytes

- NUMERIC(p) / NUMERIC(p, 0)  
  NUMERIC(10): Size = 3 + 12/2 = 9 bytes

- NUMERIC(p, s)  
  NUMERIC(10, 9): Size = 3 + 12/2 = 9 bytes
  
- DECIMAL: the same as NUMERIC
— DECIMAL(p): the same as NUMERIC(p)
— DECIMAL(p,s): the same as NUMERIC(p,s)
— NUMBER(p): the same as NUMERIC(p)
— NUMBER(p,s): the same as NUMERIC(p,s)
```

###### Example 2

Floating-Point Numbers Size Calculation: ( 3 + ( ( p ) + 2 ) / 2 )

```
- FLOAT  
  FLOAT(38): Size = 3 + 40/2 = 23 bytes
  
- FLOAT(p)  
  FLOAT(20): Size = 3 + 22/2 = 14 bytes
  
- - NUMBER: the same as FLOAT
```

**Date Data Type**

**Geomerty Data Type**

| Type     | Length       | Size (byte) |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| GEOMETRY | 8\~104857600 | length + 40 |

The actual record size is the size of each data type as indicated above, plus the size of header information. The size of the header information varies depending on the OS.

#### NULL

When a row is inserted into a table, the value of a column is set to NULL if the value for that column is not known or has not been determined yet. In other words, NULL indicates that no value exists. Therefore, NULL is not the same as 0 (zero) or blank space, and is handled differently when performing comparison operations or saving data.

If any operation other than the NVL() function or the IS NULL or IS NOT NULL conditions is performed on a NULL value, the final result of the formula containing the operation will be NULL. In other words, comparisons and operations are meaningless when performed on NULL values.

NULL can appear in columns of any data type, as long as they are not restricted by NOT NULL or PRIMARY KEY constraints.

#### Data Type Conversion

The data type conversions that are possible are shown in matrix form in the following table.

When a comparison operation is to be performed on two values having the same data type, the comparison operation is performed on the values directly without any prior conversion. In contrast, when a comparison operation is to be performed on two values having different data types, the comparison is performed after one of the values is converted into the same type as the other value. Note however that when comparisons are performed, character data types are always converted into the data type of the other comparison operand, not the other way around

The following table shows convertible matrices of implicit data types (O: shows that attributes are retained even when data types are converted). For more detailed information on how to convert an existing table's data type to MODIFY, please refer to *modify_column_clause* statement in the *SQL Reference*.

##### Implicit Data Type Conversion

If '1000' of bit type is entered into table t10 table, the conversion succeeds to integer '1000', but it is not an implicit data type conversion because the attribute of data type is changed.

```
iSQL> create table t10 (i1 integer);
Create success.
iSQL> insert into t10 values (bit'1000');
1 row inserted.
iSQL> select * from t10;
I1
--------------
1000
1 row selected.
```

Therefore, implicit data type conversion follows the rules below:

- When comparing numeric or character data types or arithmetic operations, the character data types are converted to numeric data types.
- When comparing the date data type with the character data type, the character data type is converted to the date data type and the comparison opertion is performed.
- Operation that cannot convert data types are invalidated.
- The argument used in the function is converted to the data type of the argument defined in the function.
- If a character data type or numeric data type that uses decimal precisions to a floating-point data type that uses binary precision is converted
- When executing an INSERT or UPDATE, the data type is converted to the data type of the INSERT and UPDATE columns. 

##### Example

\<Query> When comparing numeric data types, character data type '10' is converted to numeric data.

```
iSQL> create table emp (empno integer, name varchar(10), hire_date date);
insert into emp values (10,'altibase', '10-nov-2015');

iSQL> select name from emp where empno = '10';
NAME
--------------
altibase
1 row selected.
```

\<Query> When arithmetic between numeric data type and character data type, character data type '10' is converted to numeric data type.

```
iSQL> select empno + '10' from emp;
EMPNO+'10'
-------------------------
20
1 row selected.
```

\<Query> When comparing a date date type with a character data type, the character data type '10-nov-2015' is converted to a date data type.

```
iSQL> select hire_date from emp where hire_date = '10-nov-2015';
HIRE_DATE
---------------
10-NOV-2015
1 row selected.
```

\<Query> When arithmetic between numeric data type and character type is performed, binary data type cannot be converted to numeric data type and operation is invalidated.

```
iSQL> select empno + cast(12345 as nibble(6)) from emp;
[ERR-2100C : Conversion not applicable.
0001 : select EMPNO + CAST(12345 as NIBBLE(6)) from EMP
             ^                               ^
]
```

\<Query> When the function SUM receives the character data type '10' as an argument, it is converted.

```
iSQL> select sum('10') from dual;
SUM('10')
--------------
10
1 row selected.
```

\<Query> When the character data type '12.123456789' is converted to a floating-point numeric data type, the number of significant digits becomes float (11), which causes a loss of value.

```
iSQL> select float'12.123456789' from dual;
FLOAT'12.123456789'
----------------------
12.1234568
1 row selected.
```

\<Query\> The value of numeric data to be inserted is converted according to the data type of the column to be inserted and the value is INSERT.

```
iSQL>  create table t1 ( i1 char(10), i2 integer, i3 double);
Create success.
iSQL>  insert into t1 values (integer'1020', char'1928', float'123.1234');
1 row inserted.
iSQL>     select * from t1;
I1          I2          I3
---------------------------------------------------
1020        1928        123.1234
1 row selected.
```

#### Explicit Data Type Conversion

Data type conversion can be explicitly performed using SQL conversion functions or by type-casting, as shown below. The SQL functions that are used to explicitly convert a value from one data type to another are explained in the *SQL Reference*.

##### Syntax

```
datatype 'string or constant literal '
```

##### Description

Explicitly converts a numeric value from on data type to another. In the following example, the number 157.27 is converted to the characters "157.27".

```
CHAR '157.27'
```

#### Using the Character Strings

Single quotation mark should be used when displaying character strings in a SQL query. Since the single quoration mark becomes an escape letter when displaying a single quotation mark ('), the single quotation mark should be used in font.

##### Example

```
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE NAME = ’KIM’;
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (‘GILDONG’’’);//Insert the value GILDONG'
SELECT * FROM REMOTE_TABLE(link1, ‘SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE NAME=‘’KIM‘’’; //''are not the double quotation mark, it is two single quotation marks
```

#### FIXED/VARIABLE Option

FIXED or VARIABLE specifies where the data in a column will be stored.

When an entire record is stored in a contiguous space, this is called a 'FIXED' area. When one of the columns is stored in a separated space, rather than being stored in the fixed area contiguous with the rest of the record, this column is said to be stored in a 'VARIABLE' area.

When a column is stored in a variable area, the header information for the column, such as the length of the data and the pointer to the actual data, is stored in the fixed area, whereas the data for that column are stored in the variable area.

When a table is created in a disk tablespace, whether the user specifies FIXED or VARIABLE is ignored, and all columns in the table are treated as FIXED. However, when a table is created in a memory table space, the user-specified value is used.

However, the exception to this is that all LOB data type columns are always treated as VARIABLE, and the data can thus be stored in a fixed or variable area depending on the value specified using the IN ROW clause.

The following data types can be specified as VARIABLE: CHAR, VARCHAR, NCHAR, NVARCHAR, BYTE, VARBATE, NIBBLE, BIT, VARBIT, BLOB, and CLOB

#### IN ROW Clause

This clause pertains only to column data that are to be stored in a variable area. If the FIXED and IN ROW clause are both specified when a table is created, the IN ROW clause is ignored. When data are entered into a VARIABLE column, if the length of the data is less than or equal to the value specified using the IN ROW clause, the data will be stored in the fixed area, whereas if the data length is greated than the value specified using the IN ROW clause, the data will be sotred in the variable area.

Here, "data length" does not mean the length of the input data, but the length of the data to be sotred in memory or on disk, which will be somewhat larger. For example, when a column is defined as "VARCHAR(400) in row 200", data will be inserted into the fixed area if the length of the data that is input is smaller than or equal to 198, because 2 additional bytes are required when storing the data.

The default size of lob data stored in the fixed area can be specified using the MEMORY_LOB_COLUMN_IN_ROW_SIZE property for memory tables and the DISK_LOB_COLUMN_IN_ROW_SIZE for disk tables. Additionally, the default size for columns containing other types of data with the VARIABLE option can be specified using the MEMORY_VARIABLE_COLUMN_IN_ROW_SIZE property. 

Setting these properties eliminates the need to use the IN ROW clause repeatedly for each column when creating a table. For more detailed information about these properties, please refer to chapter 2.

### Character Data Types

Character data types are used to store character (alphanumeric) data, meaning words or free-form text, in either the database character set or the national character set.

In Altibase, character data typers comprise the following types:

- CHAR
- VARCHAR
- NCHAR
- NVARCHAR

#### CHAR

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/242f2c3edb0f197d371a4ec74f665ba8.jpg)

##### Syntax

```
CHAR [(size)] [ FIXED | VARIABLE [IN ROW size] ]
```

##### Description

Tihs is a character data type that has a fixed length equal to the specified size. If an input value is shorter than the specified size, the remaining area is filled with blank spaces.

The default size of CHAR column is 1byte, and its maximum length is 32000 bytes.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW clauses" section above.

#### VARCHAR

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/f7552045fb1b327e02cba948bbafeb3f.jpg)

##### Syntax

```
VARCHAR [(size)] [ FIXED | VARIABLE [IN ROW size] ]
```

##### Description

This is a character data type for storing alphanumeric data that vary in length within a specified size.

The default size of VARCHAR column is 1byte, and its maximum length is 32000 bytes.

VARCHAR is a variable length data type; that is, when the length of input data is shorter than the specified column size, only the data that were actually inserted are stored. In contrast, for the CHAR data type, if the length of input data is shorter than the column length, the remaining space in the column is padded with blank spaces. For example, if a column is defined as CHAR(10) and the word “magic” is to be stored, it will be stored as “magic_____”, where “_” represents a blank space.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" section above.

#### NCHAR

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/479310aaf34bada9e78bf3bb9c18eb8c.jpg)

##### Syntax

```
NCHAR [(size)] [ FIXED | VARIABLE [IN ROW size] ]
```

##### Description 

This is a character data type having a specified fixed length. If an input value is shorter than the specified size, the remainder is filled with blank spaces.

If the national character set is UTF16, the size of one character in an NCHAR column is fixed at 2 bytes, that is, it does not vary in length. In contrast, if the national character set is UTF8, the size of one character in an NCHAR column is not fixed; rather, it varies from 1 to 3 bytes.

The maximum size is 16000 bytes if the national character set is UTF16.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" section above.

#### NVARCHAR

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/bdc39809efd5cc54b1ee2b06d2dd638b.jpg)

##### Syntax

```
NVARCHAR [(size)] [ FIXED | VARIABLE [IN ROW size] ]
```

##### Description

This is a character data type for storing Unicode alphanumeric data that vary in length within a specified size.

If the national character set is UTF16, the size of one character in an NVARCHAR column is fixed at 2 bytes, that is, it does not vary in length. In contrast, if the national character set is UTF8, the size of one character in an NVARCHAR column is not fixed; rather, it varies from 1 to 3 bytes.

In other aspects, the NVARCHAR type is the same as the VARCHAR type, so for more detailed information please refer to the description of the VARCHAR type.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" section above.

### Numeric Data Types

Numeric data types are used to store zero as well as positive and negative numbers having fixed values. Altibase supports the following numeric types:

- BIGINT
- DECIMAL
- DOUBLE
- FLOAT
- INTEGER
- NUMBER
- NUMERIC
- REAL
- SMALLINT

#### BIGINT

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/bigint1.png)

##### Syntax

```
BIGINT
```

##### Description

This is an 8-byte integer data type.

It is equivalent to the “long” (on 64-bit systems) and “long long” (on 32-bit systems) types in the C language.

Range: -2<sup>63</sup> + 1(-9223372036854775807) \~ 2<sup>63</sup> – 1(9223372036854775807)

#### DECIMAL

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/decimal1.png)

##### Syntax

```
DECIMAL [(precision[, scale])]
```

##### Description

This data type is the same as the NUMERIC type.

#### DOUBLE

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/double1.png)

##### Syntax

```
DOUBLE
```

##### Description

This is an 8-byte floating-point numeric data type. 

It is the same as the “double” type in the C language.

#### FLOAT

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/float1.png)

##### Syntax

```
FLOAT [(precision)]
```

##### Description

This is a floating-point numeric data type that can store a value ranging from -1E+120 to 1E+120. 

Precision is the number of significant digits, that is, the number of digits used to express the mantissa of the floating-point number. 

Precision can range from 1 to 38. If it is not expressly specified, the default precision is 38. 

#### INTEGER

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/integer1.png)

##### Syntax

```
INTEGER
```

##### Description

This is an integer data type that is 4 bytes in size. 

It is the same as the “int” data type in the C language. 

It can have an integer value ranging from -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647.

#### NUMBER

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/number1.png)

##### Syntax

```
NUMBER [(precision, scale)]
```

##### Description

This is an alias of the NUMERIC data type. However, when precision and scale are not defined, they are the same as for the FLOAT data type.

#### NUMERIC

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/numberic1.png)

##### Syntax

```
NUMERIC [(precision, scale)]
```

##### Description

NUMERIC is a fixed decimal data type that can contain a total number of significant digits up to the value specified using precision and a number of digits to the right of the decimal place up to the value specified using scale. In contrast to the FLOAT data type, which is a floating-point numerical data type used for representing real numbers, when both precision and scale are omitted from a NUMERIC data type declaration, precision defaults to 38 and scale to 0, i.e. 

-  Precision can be specified within the range from 1 to 38. 
- Scale can be specified within the range from -84 to 128. 
- If precision is omitted, the default is 38. 
- If scale is omitted, the default is 0.

The following shows the respective values that would result when the input value 1234567.89 is converted to the NUMERIC types defined as shown.

-  NUMERIC=> 1234568 
- NUMERIC(9)=> 1234568 
- NUMERIC(9, 2)=> 1234567.89 
- NUMERIC(9, 1)=> 1234567.9 
- NUMERIC(6)=> Precision exceeded 
- NUMERIC(7, -2)=> 1234500 
- NUMERIC(7, 2)=> Precision exceeded

#### REAL

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/real1.png)

##### Syntax

```
REAL
```

##### Description

The data type is used to store 4-byte floating-point numeric values.

It is the same as the “float” type in the C language.

#### SMALLINT

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/smallint1.png)

##### Syntax

```
SMALLINT
```

##### Description

This data type is used to store 2-byte integer values.

It is the same as the "short" type in the C language.

It can be used to store integers ranging from -2<sup>15</sup> + 1(-32,767)에서 2<sup>15</sup> - 1(32,767) inclusive

#### Number Format Model

When data are converted using typecasting functions such as TO_CHAR or TO_NUMBER, numeric data can be specified in the following formats. A number format model consists of one or more elements that represent a number. In this section, each of these elements will be explained with reference to examples showing the related number formats. 

##### , (Comma)

###### Descriptions

Outputs a comma at the specified position.

Commas can be used multiple times.

###### Restriction

A comman cannot be placed at the end of a number, to the right of a decimal point, or at the very beginning of a number.

###### Example

```
iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR (1234, '99,99') FROM dual;
TO_CHAR (1234, '99,99')  
---------------------------
 12,34           
1 row selected.

iSQL> SELECT TO_NUMBER ( '12,34', '99,99') FROM dual;
TO_NUMBER ( '12,34', '99,99') 
--------------------------------
1234        
1 row selected.
```

##### . (Decimal Point)

###### Description

Adds a decimal point at the specified position

###### Restriction

Only one decimal point can be used within a number

###### Example

```
iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR (1.234, '99.999') FROM dual;
TO_CHAR (1.234, '99.999')  
-----------------------------
  1.234          
1 row selected.

iSQL> SELECT TO_NUMBER ( '1.234', '99.999') FROM dual;
TO_NUMBER ( '1.234', '99.999') 
---------------------------------
1.234       
1 row selected.
```

##### \$

###### Description

Prepends the $ sign to a number

###### Example

```
iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR (123, '$9999') FROM dual;
TO_CHAR (123, '$9999')  
--------------------------
  $123           
1 row selected.

iSQL> SELECT TO_NUMBER ( '$0123', '09$99') FROM dual;
TO_NUMBER ( '$0123', '09$99') 
--------------------------------
123         
1 row selected.
```

##### 0(Numeral 0)

###### Description

If the number of significant digits to be output exceeds the number of digits in the number that is input, 0's (zeroes) are prepended to the number before it is returned. In all other aspects, this element is the same as the “9” element, which is described below.

###### Example

```
iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR (123, '0999') FROM dual;
TO_CHAR (123, '0999')  
-------------------------
 0123
```

##### 9(Numeral 9)

###### Description

Uses the numeral 9 to indicate the number of digits to output. If the number of 9's is greater than the number of digits in the number that is input, the space to the left of the number is padded with blank spaces before the number is output. If the number of 9's to the left of the decimal point is less than the number of digits to the left of the decimal point in the input number, the pound sign (“#”) is repeatedly output. The number of pound signs that are output is the number of characters in the user-defined format plus one (a sign character). A decimal point placed in between 9's separates the integer and fractional parts of a number

When there are digits to the right of the decimal point in the first argument, i.e. when the input number has a fractional part, but the user-defined format either has no fractional part or has a fractional part with a smaller number of decimal places than the input number, the input number is rounded off to the number of decimal places in the user-defined format

#### DATE

###### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/date1.png)

###### Syntax

```
DATE
```

###### Description

This data type is used to store date values in 8 bytes.

The range of dates that can be stored depends on the system. Typically, the dates that can be stored range from 0001/01/01 - 9999/12/31.

The date value can be displayed in various formats using a date format string.

#### The Datetime Formal Model

The date data type is managed as numerical data d it is internally managed by the database. However, it can be displayed with character strings with the conversion function TO_CHAR or TO_DATE. The user should specify a character string of the date data type in accordance with a report format when using conversion functions.

The date data types are comprised of the following basic elements.

- AM, PM
- SCC, CC
- D, DD, DDD, DAY,DY
- HH, HH12, HH24
- MM, MON, MONTH
- MI
- Q
- SS, SSSSS, SSSSSS, SSSSSSSS, FF[1..6]
- WW, WW2, W, IW
- Y,YYY
- SYYYY, YYYY, YYY, YY, Y, RR, RRRR
- IYYY, IYY, IY, I

Along with these basic elements, the datetime format model also consists of the following punctuation marks and special characters:

- Hyphen (-) 
- Slash (/) 
- Comma (,) 
- Period (.) 
- Colon (:) 
- Single Quotation (‘) 

The meaning and use of each of these basic elements will be explained below with reference to examples.

### Binary Types

Large and unstructured data such as text, images, video, and spatial data can be stored as binary data. Altibase supports the following binary types:

- BYTE
- VARBYTE
- NIBBLE
- BIT
- VARBIT

#### BYTE

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/byte1.png)

##### Syntax

```
BYTE [(size)] [[FIXED |] VARIABLE ( IN ROW size ) ]
```

###### Description

The BYTE is a binary data type containing a specified length. The right space of inserted data is filled with '0' if a character string with a shorter length, which is shorter than the specified the length, is inserted. 

The default size of a BYTE column is 1 byte. The maximum length of a BYTE column is 32000 bytes. The data can be expressed in hexadecimal format using a combination of alphabet and numeric characters, such as '0FAE13.' The allowable alphanumeric characters are 0 (zero) to 9 and A to F. 

The specified size should be adjusted when executing data retrieval or entering the BYTE column. Two characters can be inserted in a byte; for example, if BYTE(3) is defined, values ranging from ‘000000’ to ‘FFFFFF’ can be inserted. 

In the case of inserting the lower case letters from 'a' from 'f', they are stored as being converted.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" sections above.

###### Example

```
iSQL> CREATE TABLE T1 (I1 BYTE(1), I2 BYTE(5));
Create success.
iSQL> INSERT INTO T1 VALUES (BYTE'11', BYTE'0011');
1 row inserted.
iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR(I1), TO_CHAR(I2) FROM T1;
TO_CHAR(I1)  TO_CHAR(I2)  
-----------------------------
11  0011000000  
1 row selected.
```

#### VARBYTE 

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/varbyte1.png)

##### Syntax

```
VARBYTE [(size)] [[FIXED |] VARIABLE ( IN ROW size ) ]
```

##### Description

This is a binary data type containing a variable length. The default size of a VARBYTE column is one byte, and its maximum size is 32000 bytes.

The data can be expressed through a hexadecimal format with combination of alphabets and numbers such as ‘0FAE13’. The allocable alphabet and numeric characters range from 0 to 9 and A to F. The specified size should be adjusted when executing data retrieval or entering the BYTE column.

Two characters can be inserted in a byte; for example, if BYTE(3) is defined, values ranging from ‘000000’ to ‘FFFFFF’ can be inserted. In the case of inserting the lower case letters from 'a' from 'f', they are stored as being converted.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" sections above.

##### Example

```
iSQL> CREATE TABLE T1 (I1 VARBYTE(1), I2 VARBYTE(5) );
Create success.
iSQL> INSERT INTO T1 VALUES (VARBYTE'11', VARBYTE'0011');
1 row inserted.
iSQL> SELECT TO_CHAR(I1), TO_CHAR(I2) FROM T1;
TO_CHAR(I1)  TO_CHAR(I2)  
-----------------------------
11  0011        
1 row selected.
```

#### NIBBLE

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/nibble1.png)

##### Syntax

```
NIBBLE [(size)] [[FIXED |] VARIABLE ( IN ROW size ) ]
```

##### Description

NIBBLE column is that of a single character, and the maximum size is 254nibbles. 

The data can be expressed in hexadecimal format using a combination of alphabet and numeric characters. The allowable alphanumeric characters are 0 (zero) to 9 and A to F. Unlike the BYTE type, only one character can be entered into one nibble. 

For example, for NIBBLE (6), '000000' to 'FFFFFF' can be inserted. 

When the lower case letters 'a' through 'f' are input, they are converted into upper-case letters.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" sections above.

#### BIT

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/bit1.png)

##### Syntax

```
BIT [(size)] [[FIXED |] VARIABLE ( IN ROW size ) ]
```

##### Description

This is a binary data type that has a fixed length and consists only of 0's and 1's. 

The default size of a BIT column is one bit. Its maximum size is 64000 bits. 

If an attempt is made to input a string that is longer than the specified length, an 'Invalid data type length' error will be raised. If a string shorter than the specified length is input, the space to the right of the input data is populated with 0's. If a value other than 0 or 1 is input, an 'Invalid literal' error is raised.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" sections above.

##### Example

```
iSQL> CREATE TABLE T1 ( I1 BIT(1), I2 BIT(5) );

[ERR-21011 : Invalid literal]
```

### LOB Data Type

#### Overview

The LOB (which stands for Large Object) data type is for holding large amounts of data. Up to 2 GB can be stored in one column of LOB data. Unlike other data types, the length of a LOB column does not need to be specified when a table is created. Additionally, more than one LOB type column can be defined in a table.

The LOB data type is divided into the Binary Large Object (BLOB) type, which is for holding binary data such as image and video files, and the Character Large Object (CLOB) type, which is for holding string data.

#### The Features of LOB

The LOB data type provided with Altibase has the following features:

- Data Sotrage Functions
- Partial Read
- Disk LOB Partitioning

##### Features of LOB

The LOB data type provided with Altibase has the following features:

* Data Storage Functions 
* Partial Read 
* Disk LOB Partitioning

##### Partial Read

It is possible to read only a desired portion of LOB data. A specific amount of data, offset a specific distance from the beginning of the file, can be read using the SQLGetLob function in Altibase ODBC.

##### Disk LOB Partitioning

Disk LOB data can be stored in a disk tablespace other than the one in which the table is stored. This tablespace can be configured in a method similar to partitioning. 

#### Storing LOB Columns

In most cases, LOB data are stored in a variable area, away from the rest of the record. However, if a small amount of data is stored in the LOB column, the column can be stored in an area that is contiguous with the rest of the record (i.e. in the fixed area) using the 'in row' option. Note that this is possible for memory tables only; regardless of their size, LOB data in disk tables are always stored in a separate, variable area.

Because the amount of LOB column data that is stored in the variable area is typically very large, storing it in the same tablespace as the rest of the record has a negative impact on the efficiency of usage of space. 

In a disk table, LOB column data can be stored in a tablespace other than the one containing the table to which the LOB column belongs. However, in a memory table, LOB column data cannot be stored separately, and thus are stored in the same tablespace as the table. 

#### BLOB

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/blob1.png)

##### Syntax

```
BLOB [ VARIABLE ( IN ROW size ) ]
```

##### Description

BLOB is a binary data type that can vary in length up to 4GB-1bye and is intedned for use in storing large amounts of binary data.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" sections above.

#### CLOB

##### Syntax Diagram

![](media/GeneralReference/clob1.png)

##### Syntax

```
CLOB [ VARIABLE ( IN ROW size ) ]
```

##### Description

CLOB is a character data type that can vary in length up to 4GB-bye  and is intended for use in storing large amounts of character data.

For more detailed information about the FIXED and VARIABLE clauses, please refer to the "FIXED/VARIABLE OPTIONS" and "IN ROW Clauses" sections above.

#### Restriction

- LOB type columns can't be used with cursors. 
- LOB type columns can't be used in volatile tables or disk temporary tablespaces. 
- LOB columns associated with tables in discarded tablespaces cannot be accessed. 
- LOB type columns cannot be used for partitioning conditions, because in order to partition a column it must be possible to perform comparisons on the data in the column. 
- Indexes cannot be created for LOB columns. 
- It is possible to define a NOT NULL constraint for a LOB type column. However, when an insert attempt is made, a constraint violation error may be raised while the Altibase server is internally processing the data. Therefore, it is recommended that the NOT NULL constraint not be used with LOB type columns.

### Spatial Types

The only geometry data type that is defined and supported for use with SQL in Altibase is the GEOMETRY data type. The Geometry data type consists of the following seven subtypes:

- Point
- LineString
- Polygon
- GeomCollection
- MultiPolygon
- MultiLineString
- MultiPoint

For more detailed information information about the geometry datatype, please refer to the *Spatial SQL Refernce*.

## 2. Altibase Properties

Altibase server can be run in various modes. The altibase.properties file is used to set Altibase server environment settings. The altibase.properties file contains all elements related to the operation and adjustment of the Altibase server.

This chapter describes the Altibase properties that need to be set and managed to configure and operate Altibase as a database suitable for the user's purposes.

### Configuration

There are three ways to set Altibase server environment settings. 

The first method involves making changes to the Altibase properties file, which is located at $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf/altibase.properties. Because this method of configuration is static, meaning that changes can only be made while Altibase is not running, the Altibase instance must be restarted in order for the changes to the properties file to take effect.

The second method is dynamic, meaning that configuration changes can be made even while Altibase server is running. Although this method confers the advantage of being able to make and apply changes without shutting down the server, it is not possible for all properties. For properties that can be dynamically changed, the ALTER SYSTEM or ALTER SESSION statements can be used to apply the configuration changes to the entire Altibase server or to individual sessions, respectively.

The third method of configuring the Altibase environment is through the use of operating system environment variables. Like the method involving the altibase.properties file, this configuration method is also static. Properties that are read-only or that can only have a single value can be set in this way. After specifying the environment variable as ALTIBASE_property_name, it will be necessary to reboot the database server in order to implement the changes.

Here is an example

```
$ export ALTIBASE_DEFAULT_DATE_FORMAT=YYYY/MM/DD
```

The precedence of the property-setting methods is as follows:

1. Environment variable settings
2. altibase.properties file settings
3. Default system values

As can be seen in the following example, when properties are set, because environment variables take highest precedence, the value of DEFAULT_DATE_FORMAT in the altibase.properties file is ignored, and the value of the environment variable is used.

```
$ export ALTIBASE_DEFAULT_DATE_FORMAT=YYYY-MM-DD
DEFAULT_DATE_FORMAT=YYYY-MM-DD (altibase.properties)
```

Similarly, in the following example, NLS_USE in the altibase.properties file is ignored, and UTF-8, which is specified by the NLS_USE environment variable, is used, because environment variables have the highest priority.

```
$ export ALTIBASE_NLS_USE=UTF8
NLS_USE=KO16KSC5601 (altibase.properties)
```

### Properties Overview

The property file for configuring the Altibase server is called "altibase.properties" and is located in the conf subdirectory of ALTIBASE_HOME. The properties therein are broadly grouped as follows:

- Database initialization properties
- Performance properties
- Session properties
- Transaction properties
- Backup and recovery properties
- Replication properties
- Network and security properties
- Message logging properties
- Database link properties
- Auditing properties
- C/C++ external procedure agent properties
- User account security properties
- Other properties

For more detailed information on Altibase Sharding properties, please refer to the properties chapter of "Altibase Sharding Guide" manual.

The following table lists all Altibase properties. For reference, each group in the table has the following meaning:

- D: Database initialization properties
- P: Performance properties
- S: Session properties
- T: Transaction properties
- B: Backup and recovery properties
- R: Replication properties
- NM: Network Management and security properties
- M: Message logging properties
- L: Database link properties
- U: Auditing properties
- A: C/C++ external procedure agent properties
- AS: Account Security properties
- E: Other properties

The values in the “Alter Level” column have the following meaning:

- SESSION: the property can be changed using an ALTER SESSION statement. 

- SYSTEM: the property can be changed using an ALTER SYSTEM statement. 

- BOTH: the property can be changed using either an ALTER SESSION or an ALTER SYSTEM statement

- NONE: Cannot be changed

In this chapter, each property is explained as follows:

- Property name 
- Data type 
- Default value 
- Attributes (e.g. read-only vs. read-write, single vs. multiple values) 
- Range (maximum and minimum possible values) 
- Description

### Database Initialization Properties

#### BUFFER_AREA_CHUNK_SIZE (Unit: byte)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Long

##### Default Value

33554432 (32M)

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[8192, 2<sup>64</sup>-1]

##### Description

This indicates the unit, in bytes, by which the buffer size is incremented. When the buffer size is increased, it is increased in multiples of this number. This property can’t be changed while the server is running.

#### BUFFER_AREA_SIZE (Unit: byte)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Long

##### Default Value

134217728 (128M)

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[8192, 2<sup>64</sup>-1]

##### Description

This indicates the total memory size, in bytes, used by the buffer pool of Altibase. The value specified by the user will be rounded up to the nearest multiple of BUFFER_AREA_CHUNK_SIZE.
The size of the buffer pool is governed by the size of the page that can be used by a single transaction and the number of transactions executing at the same time. Therefore, when modifying the property that is related to the number of pages or the DISK_INDEX_BUILD_MERGE_PAGE_COUNT property, the BUFFER_AREA_SIZE property shouldn’t be too small.

#### BUFFER_CHECKPOINT_LIST_CNT 

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

4

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 64]

##### Description

This indicates the number of checkpoint lists. The greater the number of checkpoint lists, the less lock contention there is among transactions.

#### BUFFER_FLUSH_LIST_CNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 64]

##### Description

This indicates the number of flush lists. The more flush lists there are, the less lock contention there is among transactions.

#### BUFFER_FLUSHER_CNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

2

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 16]

##### Description

This indicates the number of buffer flushers. This parameter can’t be changed while the server is running.

#### BUFFER_HASH_BUCKET_DENSITY

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 100]

##### Description

This indicates the percentage of BCBs (Buffer Control Blocks) that can be contained in one bucket. For example, when the number of BCBs is 100, if this value is set to 1, lock contention is minimized because the number of buckets is the same as the number of buffer frames in the buffer pool. If this value is set to 2, the number of buckets is half the number of frames, whereas if this value is set to 100, there is only one bucket. As this value is increased, less memory is used; however, operational costs increase because a single bucket will manage more buffer frames.

#### BUFFER_HASH_CHAIN_LATCH_DENSITY

##### Data type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 100]

##### Description

This sets the percentage of buckets that correspond to each latch in a hash table. For example, when the number of buckets is 1000, if this value is 1, one latch corresponds to ten buckets. If this value is 2, twenty buckets share a single latch. If this value is 100, only one latch exists for the entire hash table

This property is used to control concurrency when inserting a BCB (Buffer Control Block) into a hash table or deleting it therefrom. The more latches there are, the less hash chain latch contention will occur.

#### BUFFER_LRU_LIST_CNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

7

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 64]

##### Description

This indicates the number of LRU lists. LRU list lock contention among transactions decreases as this value is increased.

#### BUFFER_PREPARE_LIST_CNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

7

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 64]

##### Description

This indicates the number of prepare lists. The greater this value is, the less prepare list lock contention there is among transactions

##### Description

This property can minimize the space occupied by data of variable-length columns, when the data is temporarily stored in the memory tablespace.

The disk temporary tablespace is where the Altibase server temporarily stores intermediate results by default, when processing queries on disk tables or views. To enhance performance, intermediate results can be stored in the memory tablespace, using the TEMP_TBS_MEMORY  hint(please refer to Administrator's Manual and *Performance Tuning Guide*).

The default value 0 can occupy unnecessary space, due to data of variable-length columns using temporary storage space of a fixed length, as data of fixed-length columns do. To reduce such waste of space, this property can be set to 1 and only as much space as the actual data of the variable-length column is used. While memory usage is smaller, however, the speed of query processing can slow down.

0: The variable-length columns use as much temporary storage space as the length defined.

1: The variable-length columns use as much temporary storage space as the actual data.

The value of this property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

* Buffered I/O 

  To use direct I/O, set this parameter to 1, or to use buffered I/O, set it to 0. 

  The advantage of Direct I/O is that it reduces CPU resources during the occurrence of Disk I/O. On the other hand, since buffered I/O uses the read-ahead and asynchronous write techniques, it does not necessarily incur disk access every time disk I/O is requested. This means that buffered I/O can realize better performance than direct I/O from the aspect of client applications; however, buffered I/O consumes more CPU resources than direct I/O.

##### Description

This property is used to prevent abnormal increases in memory usage due to versioning when large-volume UPDATE batch tasks are performed on memory tables. If the size of logs created by a DML statement increases beyond the value specified in this property, so-called “in-place update”<sup>6</sup> is performed without versioning in order to prevent increased memory usage.

[<sup>6</sup>] In-place update” means directly updating the value of a column in an original record without creating another version of the record.

When using versioning while updating records, an X lock is placed on the record, and an IX lock is placed on the table. However, when in-place update is performed, an X lock, that is, an exclusive lock, is placed on the table. Therefore, care must be taken when setting this value as it can degrade the scalability of the corresponding table if the value is set too low.

[100000, 10000000]

##### Description

This property indicates the interval at which sessions are checked, so that the thread manager service thread can be distributed. It is expressed in units of microseconds. 

The thread manger periodically checks the status of threads, updates statistical data, and adds and deletes service threads.

#### MULTIPLEXING_MAX_THREAD_COUNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1024

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 1024]

##### Description

This is the maximum number of multiplex threads.

If the capacity of existing threads is exceeded, new threads are automatically added. However, because performance can suffer if new threads are continually created, care must be taken to set this property appropriately

Nevertheless, when queuing (QUEUE) is used, a number of threads exceeding the value specified by this property can be created.

#### MULTIPLEXING_THREAD_COUNT

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

The number of CPUs in the host

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 1024]

This parameter cannot be changed after the server has been started.

#### NORMALFORM_MAXIMUM

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

2048

##### Range

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 2<sup>32</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property specifies the maximum number of normal form nodes when normalizing a condition clause.

When the predicates in a WHERE statement of a SELECT query are complicated by the use of logical operators (AND, OR), Altibase normalizes the predicates so that the table(s) can be searched more quickly. 

There are two normalization methods: Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF). If the use of either of these normal forms results in the number of nodes specified here being exceeded, no attempt to perform normalization using that normal form is made.

If both of the normal forms exceed the number specified here, execution proceeds Not Normal Form(NNF) without the condition clause being normalized. Using the NNF method, the condition is not normalized and the index can not be used.

On the other hand, if the value specified here is set to a larger number to avoid the NNF, the process of normalizing the complicated condition clause can use vast amounts of memory, thus the normalizing process itself becomes so expensive

Therefore, it is important to avoid the excessive use of logical operators when writing condition clauses, and to write condition clauses in normal forms.

Similarly, this rule also applies to an ON predicate joined to an ON condition.

This property specifies whether or not to bind CPUs to service threads. If this is turned on, a service thread will only be assigned to the same CPU core during its execution. It will reduce costs for moving thread information from one CPU core to another CPU core.

- 0: Do not use CPU affinity feature
- 1: Use CPU affinity feature

However, logging bottlenecks can occur when using CPU affinity on HP-UX IA64. Thus, the Altibase server does not enable CPU affinity, even if the value of this property is set to 1 ( in the altibase.properties file ) on HP-UX IA64.

#### THREAD_REUSE_ENABLE 

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property indicates whether or not to reuse threads used on internal Altibase server.

0: New threads

1: Reusing threads (default value)

When you reuse a thread, reduce the cost of creating threads because using the threads waiting in memory.

#### TIMED_STATISTICS 

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property determines whether to measure the wait time for wait events and the time required for SQL operations. Using this property to specify that the time is to be measured can negatively impact performance.

0: Do not measure the time

1: Measure the time

#### TIMER_RUNNING_LEVEL 

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

The default value for this property differs depending on the platform as follows:

1 : all platforms not listed below  
2 : IBM-AIX  
3 : x86-linux, Amd64-linux

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 3]

##### Description

This property specifies how to measure the wait time for wait events and the time required for SQL operation

1: The time measurement thread measures the time at regular intervals specified in the property TIMER_THREAD_RESOLUTION.

2: The time is measured using the library functions provided with respective platforms.

3: This method is similar to #1, but the time is measured using the system clock. Therefore, this method doesn't hinder performance as much as the other methods.

If this property is set to 3 on OS platforms other than Linux and PA-RISC-HP-64, it may become impossible to start the Altibase server due to the inability to correctly check the system time. In this case, the Altibase server will leave a warning message in the altibase_boot.log file, reset the TIMER_RUNNING_LEVEL property to its default value, and restart. On platforms for which the default value is 1, the following message is written to the boot log:

[Warning] Because a TIMER_RUNNING_LEVEL of 3 is not supported on this platform,
it has been set to the default(=1) for this platform.

#### TIMER_THREAD_RESOLUTION (Unit: microsecond)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

1000

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[50, 10000000]

##### Description

If TIMER_RUNNING_LEVEL is set to 1, this property specifies the time interval.

#### TOP_RESULT_CACHE_MODE

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Only, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 3]

##### Description

This property sets whether to save the execution plan of the final result using the top result cache.

0: Disabled (default value) – Do not use the top result cache function

1: MEMORY - cache the final result of queries using only memory tables

2: DISK – cache the final result of queries using only disk tables

3: ALL – cache the final result of queries regardless of the table type.

The value of this property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM or ALTER SESSION statement while Altibase is running.

#### TOTAL_WA_SIZE (Unit: byte)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Long

##### Default Value

128MB

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[512K, 2<sup>64</sup>-1]

##### Description

This property specifies the maximum size of memory available for allocation for sorting or hashing operations

The value of this property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running. The response to a request for alteration is immediately returned, however, the altered value is not actually applied to the server until the temporary table in use is nonexistent. For further information about temporary tables, please refer to the description of the TEMP_MAX_PAGE_COUNT property.

#### TOUCH_TIME_INTERVAL (Unit: second)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

3

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 100]

##### Description

This property specifies the minimum time interval, in seconds, at which to increase the buffer access count. After the value specified in this property has passed since the last time the buffer was accessed, the access count is increased.

If this property is set to 3, which is the default value, the access count is not updated if a particular buffer is accessed again less than 3 seconds since it was previously accessed.

#### TRANSACTION_SEGMENT_COUNT (Unit: count)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

256

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[1, 512]

##### Description

This property specifies the number of transaction segments (Undo segments and TTS segments) created when the server is started. 

This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM statement while Altibase is running.

#### TRX_UPDATE_MAX_LOGSIZE (Unit: byte)

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default

10 MB

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single Value

##### Range

[0, 2<sup>64</sup>-1]

##### Description

If the size of logs created by a DML statement becomes greater than the number of bytes specified in this property, the corresponding transaction is aborted and an error is returned.

This property is used to prevent unusual increases in system load attributable to large volume batch tasks that result from the user’s carelessness.

Because the log size has no limit if this property is set to 0, logs can be used without limit when records are updated. This property can be changed using the ALTER SYSTEM or ALTER SESSION statement when Altibase is running.

#### SERIAL_EXECUTE_MODE

##### Data Type

Unsigned Integer

##### Default Value

0

##### Attributes

Read-Write, Single value

##### Range

[0, 1]

##### Description

This property optimizes the filter in the SCAN PLAN to improve the performance of the filter. At this time, it is optimized only for simple filter, and whether it is optimized can be checked in PLAN TREE.

0: Not optimized

1: Optimized
