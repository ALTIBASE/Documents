## 1. Overview of Spatial Data

------------------

This chapter explains fundamental spatial data concepts, defines some related terminology, and describes the features of spatial data that are particular to Altibase.

### The Concept of Spatial Data

#### Spatial Data

The term “spatial data” refers to the representation of multidimensional data, such as points, lines and surfaces, as a list of numbers using a particular coordinate system. A typical example of spatial data is electronic map data, which is used to represent the topography of the real world in a coordinate system. 

There are two fundamentally different kinds of spatial data: raster data and vector data. 

In a vector model, points define coordinates, and points and lines define the borders between different aspects of the real world. The location of each of these aspects on a map is specified and maintained using a consistent coordinate system. Points, lines and polygons are used to represent coordinates or geographical features that are irregularly distributed in the real world. Lines are used to represent one-dimensional features such as roads, and polygons are used to represent two-dimensional features such as forests and the like. 

In a raster model, space is uniformly divided into units known as pixels or cells. The location of a geographical aspect or set of coordinates is defined as a matrix of the pixels and cells in which the aspect or set of coordinates exists. The level of detail that it is possible to represent using a raster model depends on the cell size. The area in each cell cannot be divided any further; that is, all of the attributes that apply to the cell apply uniformly to the entire area within the cell. All cells are identical in size. A raster model typically consists of millions of cells. 

The basic units in a vector model are points, lines and polygons. Compared to a raster model, a vector model typically consists of far fewer basic units, and moreover they are not uniform in size. A vector file typically contains thousands of elements, the specific location of each element being defined by one or more consecutive coordinate values. Vector data is easier to manipulate on a computer than raster data because the number of data items is lower, and additionally because the model is easier to adjust for different scales and yields more precise results when the scale is changed. 

The advantages and disadvantages of vector and raster data are shown in the following table:

| Type        | Advantages                                                   | Disadvantages                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Vector data | • Easier to represent real-world phenomena using data structures • More space-efficient data storage • Easier construction of topological relationships • More precise graphical representation • Enables normalization of locations and attributes | • Complicated data structures • Difficulty overlapping map layers • Different topological form of respective units • Requires expensive equipment • Complicated spatial operations |
| Raster data | • Makes spatial analysis easier • Simple and clear data structure • Consistent topological form of all units • Easy to overlap map layers • Low-cost technology and rapid development • Easier integration with remote sensing data | • Difficulty constructing topological relationships • Creating a projection is time-consuming • Large amounts of graphical data • Large amounts of data loss upon data compression • Quality of output can be low |

Table 1-1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Vector and Raster Data

#### The Characteristics of Spatial Data

Spatial data are generally characterized by an indefinite form and presence in large quantities. 

Spatial data is said to be indefinite because the content and structure of each spatial object are represented in different ways depending on the type of the spatial object. Furthermore, even two objects of the same type can differ in the number of points, sub-objects, etc. they are comprised of, causing them to have different forms and lengths. 

Spatial data is generally voluminous. The size of spatial data can exceed the size of a storage page in a DBMS. For example, it can take megabytes (MB) of storage just to store the data for the coastline of a single nation. 

Because of these characteristics, there are many considerations that do not apply to non-spatial data that must be taken into account to store and manipulate spatial data efficiently. 

#### Spatial Data Models

There are two conventional spatial data models: the field-based model, in which a space is represented using a series of attributes, and the entity-based model, in which a space is represented as an object (or entity) made up of a set of points. In the field-based model, in which each point in space has one or more attributes, spaces are defined in a manner similar to the use of a continuous function in the Cartesian coordinate system.

However, the field-based model does not take the concept of objects, which is important to the entity-based model, into account. The objects that are usually the most important in the entity-based model include points, which indicate the locations of objects; lines, which indicate two connected points; polylines, which indicate a series of connected lines; and polygons. 

The spatial data model that was put forth by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is a conceptual model. That is, the model was defined in terms of spatial schema, and is an abstract data model rather than one that was intended for use in a particular implementation. This spatial schema forms the basis for the ISO 19107 Spatial Schema standard and is used in many other OGC specifications such as the OpenGIS Simple Features Specification and the GML Implementation Specification. 

Spatial schema consists of the geometry package, which is a geometric object model in which is proposed a quantitative technique for describing the spatial characteristics of features that are abstractions of real world features, and the topology package, which provides a model for describing the relationships between geometric objects. 

Based on the data models in the abstract specification, the OGC proposed more concrete OpenGIS geometry models in specifications intended for use in practical implementation, such as the OpenGIS Simple Features Specification. 

The so-called “Geometry Class” is a root class and an abstract class, and consists of subclasses such as Point, Curve, Surface and GeometryCollection. All geometric objects are defined in relation to the spatial reference system for a defined coordinate space. The actual classes that can be instantiated for use are the Point, LineString, Polygon, GeometryCollection, MultiPoint, MultiLineString and MultiPolygon classes. The rest of the classes are defined as abstract classes.

#### Spatial Database Systems

A spatial database contains both non-spatial data, typically represented using characters and numbers, and spatial data, which are represented as coordinate values for spatial objects. The geographic objects (usually spatial objects) that are managed in a spatial database have both general and geometric attributes, and include topological information, that is, information about the spatial relationships between objects. 

In order to store and manage such spatial data efficiently, a spatial database system must be able to represent and control non-spatial and spatial data at the logical level, and save and manage the data efficiently at the physical level. Therefore, in a spatial database system, it must be possible to represent data logically, and to provide functions for performing spatial operations on spatial data. 

On the physical level, it must be possible to store data efficiently, and to provide spatial indexing so that spatial data can be accessed efficiently. In addition, it must be possible to efficiently store and manage the topological and general attributes of the spatial data that describe spatial objects.

Spatial data modeling is a technique that defines how spatial data is represented, and must support spatial data types such as points, lines and surfaces which can be used to describe real-world features. These spatial data types must be as simple and precise as possible, even when they are used to represent compound spatial objects. Additionally, the use of spatial operators must be supported with all spatial data types. 

Spatial operators are those that are used to perform various kinds of spatial analysis, including the analysis of the topological relationships between spatial objects, so that spatial queries can be processed efficiently. For this reason, spatial database systems must support a variety of useful spatial operators.

#### Spatial

In general, complex and expensive operations on geometric figures are required in order to process spatial queries. Traditionally, point object operations involve sequential scanning and evaluation to determine which points are included in which objects. This incurs high processing costs because of frequent, repeated disk access and the repetitive assessment of geometric conditions. 

Therefore, efficient spatial access methods have been developed in order to reduce the number of objects that actually need to be processed in order to analyze large amounts of stored spatial data. A so-called “spatial access method” is a method in which a spatial index is used to reduce the number of objects that need to be processed when processing a spatial query. This method has a time complexity requirement, whereby it must be possible to conduct a search in sub-linear time, and a spatial complexity requirement, whereby the size of a spatial index must be smaller than the size of the indexed data. It also requires dynamic update, by which an object can be added to or removed from a spatial index without entailing a great reduction in performance. A typical spatial data access method that satisfies these requirements is one that uses an R-Tree. 

The R-Tree, a height-balanced hierarchical multi-dimensional index structure that was originally designed for use with secondary storage, is a generalization of the B-tree for use with multi-dimensional data spaces. Like a B-tree, an R-Tree has a height-balanced tree structure, meaning that references to objects exist only at terminal nodes. The R-tree, which uses an MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) to represent a spatial object, was designed to reduce the number of nodes that must be visited in order to locate a spatial object. In addition, because R-trees support the dynamic creation of tree structures, update and search operations can be performed on one R-tree at the same time, and there is no need to periodically rearrange the tree structure.

#### Spatial Reference Systems

In a spatial reference system, mutual associations are drawn between locations in real-world space and spatial objects that are defined on the basis of coordinates in mathematically expressed vector space. Spatial references can be realized using either spatial coordinates or identifiers. 

A spatial reference system can be used to define a coordinate system for use with spatial data and the range of geographic area to which each data item refers.

#### Coordinate System

A coordinate system is used to specify the relative location of objects in a given area (for example, all or part of the earth's surface). 

A reference system that is used to represent a location on the earth using longitude and latitude values is, together with an ellipsoid that represents the topology of the earth, called a geodetic reference system. In Korea, the Korean Geodetic System, which is based on the Bessel Ellipsoid and on longitude, latitudes and azimuth values determined through astronomical observations, is used. GPS surveying has become more common, the demand for universal location reference systems that can be used around the world has grown, giving rise to international geodetic systems that can be used the same way all over the world. International survey systems can be classified as ITRF (International Terrestrial Reference Frame), WGS (World Geodetic System) and PZ (Parametry Zemli) systems, depending on the reference and ellipsoid on which they are based.

##### Reference Ellipsoids

A reference ellipsoid is a mathematical representation of the earth. It is a model of the earth that is obtained by rotating the earth around the major and minor axes of an earth-shaped ellipsoid. It is used as a reference model on which to base coordinate values. Various ellipsoids are used around the world, depending on the conditions in each country. One universal ellipsoid that is used around the world is WGS84.

##### Geoids

A geoid is a model of the earth's topology that is based on an imagined average sea level if the ocean were somehow able to penetrate the continents, in which all points are perpendicular to the direction of gravity. In other words, a geoid is an ellipsoid that represents the earth and throughout the surface of which the gravitational pull of the earth is the same, and represents a reference surface 0m above sea level which is the average sea level. Although the topology of a geoid is irregular due to differences in the gravitational pull of the earth in different locations, it can be approximated as an ellipsoid having a regular surface.

##### The Datum

A datum, meaning a parameter or a set of parameters that is either used unchanged or as the basis for the calculation of other parameters, is a value (i.e. a point, line, or surface) that is determined based on an observation and used as an arbitrary basis for calibrating other observations. A datum consists of longitudinal, latitudinal and azimuth values, and can also be referred to as a “horizontal datum” or “horizontal geodetic datum”. In addition, a datum defines an origin, scale and direction according to the axes of the terrestrial coordinate system, and can be a geodetic datum, a vertical datum or an engineering datum. When a datum is changed, the coordinates of its spatial data are also changed.

#### Projection

Projection is the process in which three-dimensional information about all or part of the earth is converted to a two-dimensional map by projecting it onto a two-dimensional planar surface, such as a cylinder, a cone, a disk, etc. Everyday paper maps, as well as the numerical maps that are used for 2D GIS, are created using this projection process. Because shape, distance, direction, scale and area are inevitably distorted during the projection process, it is important to choose a projection method such that the distortion of the area to be projected is minimized. 

In Korea, the Transverse Mercator (TM) projection method is used to create topographical maps. In TM projection, a geographic area is projected by bringing it into contact with a cylinder at its center meridian line (e.g. 127 ° East Longitude), which accurately projects the area close to the center meridian line. This projection method is thus frequently used when projecting areas that are extensive in the North-South direction. As one moves further from the center meridian, the distortion of distance, area, scale and direction becomes greater.

### The Characteristics of Spatial Data in Altibase

The method by which spatial data is processed in Altibase has the following characteristics:

-   Since Altibase features high-performance memory database technology and includes a spatial data model, it is superior not only for existing GIS applications, but also for the next-generation high-speed spatial data processing systems that will be required in the ubiquitous data environment. Moreover, because the spatial model is integrated with a conventional SQL-based RDBMS model, existing DBMS development environments and expertise can be utilized, leading to increased productivity.
  
-   In Altibase, spatial data (i.e. information about the location of a particular area) can be stored, managed and analyzed alongside traditional character and numeric data. This allows users to create, analyze and utilize spatial data such as information about the locations of office buildings or the size of flooded areas.
  
-   The capability of Altibase has been expanded through the inclusion of a series of advanced spatial data types for representing geometric objects such as points, lines and polygons, as well as numerous functions and features for working with these data types. Because it is so easy to integrate business data and spatial data, users can readily increase the range of business logic in their database applications.

### Spatial Data Terminology 

-   Closed  
    If the start and end points of a LINESTRING object are the same, the spatial object is said to be “closed”. In order for a spatial object to be considered to be a closed object, all of the elements that the spatial object consists of must be closed. For a more detailed explanation of this concept, please refer to the description of the ISCLOSED function. 
-   Compound Object  
    Compound objects are those spatial objects that are made up of two or more spatial objects. 
-   Dimension  
    A dimension is the minimum number of real numbers needed to represent the location of any point within a figure, object or space. A point has zero (0) dimensions, a straight line has one dimension, a plane has two dimensions, and a body that has volume has 3 dimensions. Note that n-dimensional space is possible, as there is no limit on the number of dimensions. 
-   Element  
    An element is any of the common figures that comprise a spatial object. A single spatial object can be constructed from elements such as points, lines or surfaces. 
-   Empty  
    A spatial object in which no elements exist is said to be “empty”. Unlike NULL, which implies that the contents of an object are unknown, the empty state indicates definitively that the object contains nothing. For a more detailed explanation of this concept, please refer to the description of the ISEMPTY function. 
-   Line  
    A line can be thought of as a trace of the continuous movement of a point. Next to the point, the line is the simplest figure. It has a location and a length, but no width or thickness. Lines can be straight or curved. 
-   Multiple Object  
    Multiple objects are spatial objects that are made up of more than one spatial object having the same form and comprise the MultiPoint, which consists only of points, the MultiLineString, which consists only of LineStrings, and the MultiPolygon, which consists only of Polygons. 
-   Point  
    This is the simplest spatial object. It has a location, but no size. 
-   Scale  
    Scale is the ratio between the distance shown in a map or picture and the actual distance in the real world. A scale value is typically expressed as a ratio, which enables the same units to be used for measurements on the map and in the real world. If, for example, the scale of a map is 1:25,000, one real-world unit of distance on the map represents 25,000 times that much distance in the real world. In other words, 1 cm on the map represents 25,000 cm in the real world. Note that the scale of a map describes horizontal distances only, and is not applicable to measurements of area or height. 
-   Simple  
    If the elements of a spatial object do not have unusual points, such as intersections or points of tangency, the spatial object is considered to be “simple”. For a more detailed explanation of this concept, please refer to the description of the ISSIMPLE function. 
-   Spatial Object  
    A spatial object consists of both spatial data, which are used to represent the real world, and operations, such as procedures, methods and functions, related to this data. 
-   Surface  
    A surface can be thought of as a trace of the continuous movement of a line, or as a planar form that cannot be described using a single point or line. Surfaces are classified as either planes or curved surfaces depending on whether their profile protrudes from a plane (i.e. a flat surface). Generally, the term “surface” is understood to refer to a planar surface, unless otherwise specified.
-   

## 2. Spatial SQL

-----------

This chapter describes the spatial data types, spatial SQL statements, and spatial functions and operators that are supported in Altibase. 

The implementation of spatial SQL in Altibase conforms with the ISO SQL/MM spatial standards and the Simple Features Specification for SQL proposed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). 

Because the Simple Features Specification for SQL is an extension of standard SQL, users who are familiar with SQL can continue to use queries in the way to which they are accustomed when dealing with spatial data.

### GEOMETRY Data Type

An understanding of spatial data types is required in order to manipulate spatial data in a database using spatial SQL. In this section, the spatial data types will be described in detail.

The spatial data type that is currently supported for use with SQL is the GEOMETRY type. The GEOMETRY type consists of the following 7 subtypes:

-   POINT

-   LINESTRING

-   POLYGON

-   MULTIPOINT

-   MULTILINESTRING

-   MULTIPOLYGON

-   GEOMETRYCOLLECTION

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the GEOMETRY data type and the seven subtypes that it consists of.

[Figure 2‑1]  The relationships between the GEOMETRY data type and the seven subtypes

The GEOMETRY data type, as supported in Altibase, uses X and Y coordinates to represent a POINT, which represents a single point in space, and uses two or more POINTS to represent a LINESTRING. Depending on whether or not it is closed (i.e. on whether the two terminal points are the same), a LINESTRING is referred to either as a LINE1, which is unclosed, or as a LINEARRING2, which is closed. The terms LINE and LINEARRING are used to indicate the shape of spatial objects, but do not denote mutually distinct data types. 

A POLYGON consists of one or more LINEARRINGS. A MULTIPOINT consists of one or more POINTS, a MULTILINESTRING consists of one or more LINESTRINGS, and a MULTIPOLYGON consists of one or more POLYGONS. Finally, a GEOMETRYCOLLECTION can comprise any of the foregoing objects. In addition to the seven subtypes described above, Altibase also supports the EMPTY type. The EMPTY type can only be created by performing operations on spatial objects. The EMPTY type is returned by an operator whose return type is GEOMETRY when there is nothing to return as the result of an operation.

#### Classification of Subtypes

The criteria that are used to distinguish the 7 subtypes of the GEOMETRY data type from each other are described in the following [Table 2-1]:

| Subtype Name       | Constituent Elements                                    | Dimensions               | Simple         | Closed | Intererior                          | Boundary                                                     | Exterior |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Point              | One Point                                               | 0                        | O              | X      | Point                               | Ø<sup>1</sup>                                                | Surface  |
| LINESTRING         | Two or more POINTs                                      | 1                        | \*<sup>2</sup> | \*     | Line                                | Ø<sup>1</sup> when closed; both end points when not closed   | Surface  |
| POLYGON            | One or more simple closed LINESTRINGs                   | 2                        | O<sup>3</sup>  | O      | Surface                             | A LINESTRING that includes all internal and external rings   | Surface  |
| MULTIPOINT         | One or more POINTs                                      | 0                        | \*             | X      | Point                               | Ø                                                            | Surface  |
| MULTILINESTRING    | One or more LINESTRINGs                                 | 1                        | \*             | \*     | Line                                | Ø<sup>1</sup> when closed; both end points when not closed   | Surface  |
| MULTIPOLYGON       | One or more POLYGONs                                    | 2                        | O              | O      | Surface                             | A LINESTRING taht includes all internal and external rings in all spatial objects that is consists of | Surface  |
| GEOMETRYCOLLECTION | Two or more non-GEOMETRYCOLLECTION type spatial objects | Maximum of 2 diemensions | \*             | \*     | The interior of all spatial objects | The boundaries of all spatial objects                        | Surface  |

[<sup>1</sup>] This symbol indicates an empty set that contains no results.

[<sup>2</sup>] This symbol means that this subtype may or may not satisfy this condition.

[<sup>3</sup>] A non-simple POLYGON violates the definition of a POLYGON, and thus cannot be inserted.

[Table 2-1] Subtypes of the Geometry Data Type

#### POINT

##### Syntax

![](media/SpatialSQL/image11.gif)

![](media/SpatialSQL/image12.gif)

![](media/SpatialSQL/image13.gif)

​                                                       POINT( x y )

​                                                       x: The x-coordinate

​                                                       y: The y-coordinate

##### Description

A POINT represents the location of a single point in a coordinate system. It is a zero-dimensional simple unclosed spatial object that has a single point as its only element. The interior of the spatial object is the POINT itself. It has no boundary. The exterior is the surrounding surface, not including the POINT itself.

##### Characterstic 

A POINT has x- and y-coordinate values.

##### Example

```
CREATE TABLE building ( id INTEGER, obj GEOMETRY ) ;
INSERT INTO building VALUES (1, GEOMETRY'POINT( 10 10 ) ') ;
INSERT INTO building VALUES (2, GEOMFROMTEXT('POINT(20 20)'));
INSERT INTO building VALUES (3, POINTFROMTEXT('POINT( 100 100 )')) ;
INSERT INTO building VALUES (4, GEOMETRY'POINT EMPTY');
INSERT INTO building VALUES (5, GEOMFROMTEXT('POINT EMPTY'));
INSERT INTO building VALUES (6, POINTFROMTEXT('POINT EMPTY'));
```

#### MULTIPOINT

##### Syntax

![](media/SpatialSQL/image14.gif)

​                                                                         MULTIPOINT(x1 y1 [, xn yn ])

​                                                            x<sub>n</sub>: The value of the x-coordinate for the nth point

​                                                            y<sub>n</sub> : The value of the y-coordinate for the nth point

##### Description

A MULTIPOINT is a zero-dimensional unclosed spatial object that has one or more POINTs as its elements. The interior of the spatial object is defined by the points that comprise the MULTIPOINT object. It has no boundary. The exterior is the surrounding surface, not including the POINTs themselves.

##### Characteristics

A MULTIPOINT is considered simple if no two of its points have the same coordinates.

##### Limitation

A MULTIPOINT only has points as its constituent elements. These points are not interconnected or ordered.

##### Example

```
CREATE TABLE building ( id INTEGER, obj GEOMETRY ) ;
INSERT INTO building VALUES (1, GEOMETRY'MULTIPOINT( 10 10, 20 20 )') ;
INSERT INTO building VALUES (2, GEOMFROMTEXT('MULTIPOINT( 10 20, 20 30 ) ')) ;
INSERT INTO building VALUES (3, MPOINTFROMTEXT('MULTIPOINT( 100 100, 150 150 )')) ;
INSERT INTO building VALUES (4, GEOMETRY'MULTIPOINT EMPTY');
INSERT INTO building VALUES (5, GEOMFROMTEXT('MULTIPOINT EMPTY'));
INSERT INTO building VALUES (6, MPOINTFROMTEXT('MULTIPOINT EMPTY'));
```

#### LINESTRING

​                                                            x<sub>n</sub> : The value of the x-coordinate for the nth point

​                                                            y<sub>n</sub> : The value of the y-coordinate for the nth point

##### Description

A LINESTRING is a one-dimensional spatial object that has two or more POINTs as its elements. These POINTs are connected with each other via straight lines. The interior of the spatial object is the actual segment that is the LINESTRING. If the segment is closed, the LINESTRING has no boundary, whereas if the segment is not closed, the LINESTRING has the two terminal POINTs as its boundary. The exterior is the surrounding surface, not including the LINESTRING itself.

##### Characteristics

If a LINESTRING is closed and simple, it is called a LINEARRING. In the following figure, LINESTRING #3 is a LINEARRING because it is a closed and simple LINESTRING, while LINESTRING #4 is not a LINEARRING because even though it is closed, it is not a simple LINESTRING.

![](media/SpatialSQL/image17.gif)

[Figure 2-2] Examples of LineString

##### Example

```
CREATE TABLE road ( id INTEGER, obj GEOMETRY ) ;
INSERT INTO road VALUES (1, GEOMETRY'LINESTRING( 0 18, 10 21, 16 23, 28 26, 44 31 )') ;
```

```
INSERT INTO road VALUES (4, GEOMETRY'LINESTRING EMPTY');
INSERT INTO road VALUES (5, GEOMFROMTEXT('LINESTRING EMPTY'));
INSERT INTO road VALUES (6, LINEFROMTEXT('LINESTRING EMPTY'));
```

#### MULTILINESTRING

​                                           MULTILINESTRING( (x1 y1, x2 y2 [, xn yn ] ) [, (x1 y1, x2 y2 [, xn yn ] ) ] )

​                                            x<sub>n</sub> : The value of the x-coordinate for the nth point

​                                             y<sub>n</sub> : The value of the y-coordinate for the nth point

##### Description

A MULTILINESTRING is a one-dimensional spatial object comprising one or more LINESTRINGS (segments) as its elements. The interior of the spatial object is defined by the segments that comprise the MULTILINESTRING. The boundary of the MULTILINESTRING consists of the two terminal POINTs of any constituent segments that are not closed. If all segments are closed, the MULTILINESTRING has no boundary. The exterior is the surrounding surface, not including the segments.

##### Characteristics

If all of the LINESTRINGs that a MULTILINESTRING consists of are closed, the MULTILINESTRING itself is closed, and has no boundary

In the following figure, the boundaries of the MultiLineStrings are {s1, e2} for (1), {s1, e1} for (2) and φ (i.e. an empty set) for (3).

​                                                            POLYGON( (x1 y1, x2 y2, x3 y3 [, xn yn ])[, (x1 y1, x2 y2, x3 y3 [, xn yn ] ) ]  )

​                                                       x<sub>n</sub> : The value of the x-coordinate for the nth point

​                                                       y<sub>n</sub> : The value of the y-coordinate for the nth point

##### Description

A POLYGON is a spatial object that represents a surface in a space. It is a two-dimensional spatial object comprising one or more simple closed LINESTRINGs. A POLYGON must also be simple and closed. The interior of the spatial object is the surface defined by the POLYGON. The exterior is the surrounding surface, not including the POLYGON itself. The boundary consists of any exterior rings that comprise the POLYGON. For example, the boundary of a POLYGON that consists of an exterior ring and an interior ring is the LINESTRINGs that respectively define the exterior ring and the interior ring.

##### Characteristics

-   A POLYGON is defined as a surface that has one exterior boundary and 0 (zero) or more interior boundaries. 
-   A POLYGON is a simple closed spatial object. 
-   The boundary of a POLYGON consists of LINEARRINGs that form interior and exterior boundaries.

The following figure shows representative examples of POLYGONs.

![](media/SpatialSQL/image28.gif)

[Figure 2-4] Examples of Polygon

##### Requirements for a Polygon

No two closed LINESTRINGs that form the boundary of a POLYGON can intersect or be tangent to each other. They can only meet each other at a single point, and both LINESTRINGs must have POINTs defined where they meet.

```
∀ P ∈ Polygon, ∀ c1, c2 ∈ P.Boundary(), c1 ≠ c2, ∀p, q ∈ Point,
p, q ∈ c1, p ≠ q, [p ∈ c2 ⇒ q ∈ c2]
```

The interior ring must not be connected to the exterior of a Polygon. 

A Polygon cannot have a segment protruding from it, nor can it have within it a point that is not part of a closed LINESTRING.

```
∀ P ∈ Polygon, P = Closure(Interior(P))
```

The entire interior of a POLYGON must form a single interconnected surface. 

The following figure shows objects that do not satisfy the above requirements, and thus cannot be represented as POLYGONS.

```

#### MULTIPOLYGON

##### Syntax

![](media/SpatialSQL/image33.gif)

​                                        MULTIPOLYGON( ( (x1 y1, x2 y2, x3 y3 [, xn yn ]) [, (x1 y1, x2 y2, x3 y3 [, xn
​                                         yn ] ) ] ) [ ( (x1 y1, x2 y2, x3 y3 [, xn yn ]) [, (x1 y1, x2 y2, x3 y3 [, xn yn
​                                         ] ) ] ) ] ) )

##### Description

A MultiPolygon is a collection class that consists of Polygons as its constituent elements. It is a two-dimensional simple unclosed spatial object comprising one or more POLYGONs as its elements. The interior of the spatial object is the surfaces defined by the constituent POLYGONs. The exterior is the surrounding surface, not including the POLYGONs. Its boundary is defined by the LINESTRINGs that define exterior and interior rings of the constituent POLYGONs.

##### Characteristics

-   A MULTIPOLYGON is a simple closed spatial object. 
-   The boundary of a MULTIPOLYGON is a set of LINESTRINGs.

The following figure shows examples of MULTIPOLYGONs. The third MultiPolygon doesn’t comprise an exterior Polygon and an interior Polygon, but two Polygons, one of which is above the other.

![](media/SpatialSQL/image34.gif)

[Figure 2-6] Examples of MULTIPOLYGONs

##### Limitation

The intersection of the interiors of two Polygons that comprise a MultiPolygon is an empty set.

```
∀ M ∈ MultiPolygon, ∀ Pi, Pj ∈ M.Geometries(), i≠ j, Interior(Pi) ∩ Interior(Pj) = Ø
```

Two LINESTRINGs that form all or part of the boundary of a MULTIPOLYGON can only meet each other at individual POINTS, and both LINESTRINGs must have POINTs defined where they meet.

```
∀ M ∈ MultiPolygon, ∀ Pi, Pj ∈ M.Geometries(), ∀ ci ∈ Pi.Boundaries(), cj ∈ Pj.Boundaries() ,ci ∩ cj = {p1, ....., pk │ pi ∈ Point, 1 <= i <= k}
```

A MULTIPOLYGON cannot have a segment protruding from it, nor can it have within any of its constituent POLYGONs a point that is not part of a closed LINESTRING.

```
∀ M ∈ MultiPolygon, M = Closure(Interior(M))
```

The following figure shows objects that do not satisfy the above criteria, and thus cannot be represented as MULTIPOLYGONs.

##### Description

A GEOMETRYCOLLECTION is a set of one or more spatial objects. 

A GEOMETRYCOLLECTION is a spatial object that has a maximum of two dimensions and consists of two or more spatial objects as its elements. These elements cannot themselves be other GEOMETRYCOLLECTION type objects, meaning that the GEOMETRYCOLLECTION type cannot be nested. The interior of the spatial object is the collective interiors of all of the constituent spatial objects, and its boundary consists of the boundaries of all the spatial objects it contains. The exterior is the surrounding surface, not including the elements that the GEOMETRYCOLLECTION consists o

##### Limitation

The criteria for a GEOMETRYCOLLECTION object depend on the criteria for each of the spatial objects that comprise the GEOMETRYCOLLECTION.

##### Examples

```
CREATE TABLE test1 ( id INTEGER, obj GEOMETRY ) ;
INSERT INTO test1 VALUES (1, GEOMETRY'GEOMETRYCOLLECTION( POINT( 6 16 ), LINESTRING( 4 26, 16 28, 14 16, 24 12 ))') ;

INSERT INTO test1 VALUES (5, GEOMFROMTEXT('GEOMETRYCOLLECTION EMPTY'));
INSERT INTO test1 VALUES (6, GEOMCOLLFROMTEXT('GEOMETRYCOLLECTION EMPTY'));
```

### The Format of the GEOMETRY Data Type

In Altibase, the GEOMETRY data type can be represented using any of the three ways described below:

-   WKT (Well-Known Text): A text format in which a spatial object is represented using letters and numbers. This allows it to be processed directly within SQL applications or other similar applications. The WKT format was designed using simple gramar for easy readability. 
-   WKB (Well-Known Binary): A format in which a spatial object is represented in binary form. It was designed for the purpose of efficiently transferring and performing operations on GEOMETRY type data.
-   EWKT(Extended Well-Known Text) format: A text format in which Spatial Reference Identifier (SRID) information representing spatial objects has been added to the WKT format.
-   EWKB(Extended Well-Known Binary) format: A text format in which Spatial Reference Identifier (SRID) information representing spatial objects is added to the WKB format
-   Internal Binary: A format in which data is stored within Altibase. It was designed for the purpose of efficiently managing and performing spatial operations on spatial data. Data saved in the internal binary format of Altibase can only be manipulated using the C API. The C API will be described in Spatial Application Development.

#### WKT (Well-Known Text) 

WKT (Well-known Text) is a format for representing a spatial object using letters and numbers. WKT is defined using Backus-Naur Form (BNF) notation, as shown below:

#### WKB (Well-Known Binary)

WKB (Well-known Binary) is a format in which a spatial object is represented in binary form. 

This is the binary form put forth in the OGC Standards. It is used to ensure data compatibility between heterogeneous spatial DBMSs. 

The WKB format represents a spatial object using UNSIGNED INTEGER and DOUBLE type numerical data. It is encoded using either NDR or XDR, which differ from each other with respect to byte order (Endian). 

The byte order of XDR, which stands for “External Data Representation”, is Big Endian, whereas that of NDR, which stands for “Network Data Representation”, is Little Endian. The UNSIGNED INTEGER data type is a 32-bit data type whose value can be a positive integer in the range from 0 to 4294967295. DOUBLE is a 64-bit double precision data type that follows the IEEE 754 double precision format for representing double precision numbers. 

The WKB representation of spatial objects is shown below. The basic type is the POINT, which is represented using two DOUBLE type numbers. The representations of all other kinds of spatial objects are based on the definition of the POINT, or on the definitions of other spatial objects that are themselves defined based on the definition of the POINT.

```
/ / Basic Type definitions
/ / byte : 1 byte
/ / unit32 : 32 bit unsigned integer (4 bytes)
/ / double : double precision number (8 bytes)
/ / Building Blocks : Point, LinearRing

Point {
double x ;
double y ;
} ;

LinearRing {
unit32 numPoints ;
Point points{numPoints} ;
}

enum wkbGeometryType {
wkbPoint = 1,
wkbLineString = 2,

} ;

[Figure 2‑8] Example of WKB Structure

In this example, the Little Endian (NDR) byte order is used, and a POLYGON with one exterior ring and one interior ring is described. Each of the exterior and interior rings consists of three points.


#### EWKT (Extended Well-Known Text)

EWKT indicates SRID information in addition to WKT format. Except for the notation of SRID information, the notation is identical to the WKT format. The EWKT format is not an OpenGIS standard and an example of spatial data described using the EWKT format is as follows.

| Format         | WKT Expression | SRID                                                                                 | Description                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| Point              | SRID=4326;POINT(10 10)                                                                            | 4326 | One Point; SRID is 4326                               |
| LineString         | SRID=100;LINESTRING(10 10, 20 20, 30 40)                                                         | 100 | 3-point linestring; SRID is 100        |
| Polygon            | SRID=-999;POLYGON( (10 10, 10 20, 20 20, 20 15, 10 10) )                                          | -999 | A polygon consisting of one outer ring and zero inner rings; SRID is -999 |
| MultiPoint         | SRID=0;MULTIPOINT(10 10, 20 20)                                                                | 0 | Multipoint with two points; SRID is 0 |

#### EWKB (Extended Well-Known Binary)

EWKB represents SRID information in addtion to the WKB format. Except for the notation of SRID information, the notation is identical to the WKB format. The EWKB format is not an OppenGIS standard.  The notation of the EWKB format is almost the same as that of the WKB format, but after the byte order (one byte; either NDR or XDR) and the GEOMETRY data type (four bytes; POINT, MULTIPOINT, etc.), the four-byte SRID is written differently. After the SRID notation, the object information is expressed in binary form similar to the WKB format.

| Format          | WKT Expression | SRID                                                                                 | Description                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| Point              | SRID=4326;POINT(10 10)                                                                            | 4326 | One Point; SRID is 4326                      |
| LineString         | SRID=100;LINESTRING(10 10, 20 20, 30 40)                                                         | 100 | 3-point linestring; SRID is 100 |
| Polygon            | SRID=-999;POLYGON( (10 10, 10 20, 20 20, 20 15, 10 10) )                                          | -999 | A polygon consisting of one outer ring and zero inner rings; SRID is -999 |
| MultiPoint         | SRID=0;MULTIPOINT(10 10, 20 20)                                                                | 0 | Multipoint with two points; SRID is 0 |



### DDL For Geometry

This section will describe with examples the syntax and features of SQL DDL statements used to create database objects. A detailed description will be provided only for aspects directly related to the GEOMETRY data type. For a more detailed description of each SQL statement described below, please refer to the Altibase *SQL Reference.*

#### CREATE TABLE

##### Syntax

```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name GEOMETRY [(precision)] [(SRID srid)]);
```

##### Description

This is is used to specify the maximum size of the column to be created. The allowable range is from 16 bytes to 100 megabytes. If not specified, the column will default to a size of 32,000 bytes. Any attempt to INSERT a spatial object that occupies more space than the precision specified here will fail.

This specifies the SRID of the column to be created. A 4-byte integer can be used, which will default to 0 if not specified.

For more detailed information about the CREATE TABLE statement, please refer to the *SQL Reference.*

> ##### Limitations
>
> The following limitations apply to the use of the GEOMETRY column:
>
> -   A GEOMETRY column cannot be used as a primary key. 
>-   The UNIQUE constraint cannot be specified for a GEOMETRY column.
> 

##### Examples

Create a table having an id column, whose type is INTEGER, and an obj column, whose type is GEOMETRY.

```
iSQL> CREATE TABLE t1 ( id INTEGER, obj GEOMETRY ) ;
Create success.
```

Create a table having an *id* column, whose type is INTEGER, as well as a GEOMETRY column named *obj* having a maximum size of 128 bytes.

```
iSQL> CREATE TABLE t2 ( id INTEGER, obj GEOMETRY (128) ) ;
Create success.
```

Create a table with a GEOMETRY column obj with an interger column ID and SRID 100.

```
iSQL> CREATE TABLE t3 ( id INTEGER, obj GEOMETRY SRID 100) ;
Create success.
```

#### CREATE INDEX

##### Syntax

```
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name ( column_name ) [INDEXTYPE IS RTREE];
```

##### Description

When an index is created on a column using the GEOMETRY data type, there is no need to specify an INDEXTYPE because an R-Tree index is used automatically. If a user attempts to set the INDEXTYPE to BTREE, an error will occur. 

For more detailed information about CREATE INDEX, please refer to the *SQL Reference*.

> ##### Limitations
>
> -   The UNIQUE option cannot be specified for the index. 
>-   The use of a GEOMETRY type column in a so-called “compound index” is not supported. That is, if an index is created on the basis of two or more columns, none of those columns can be a GEOMETRY type column. 
> -   R-Tree indexes can be based on GEOMETRY type columns only
>

##### Examples

Create an R-Tree index *idx_t1* based on the GEOMETRY type column *obj* in table t1

```
iSQL> CREATE INDEX idx_t1 ON t1 ( obj ) ;
Create success.
```

Create an R-Tree index idx_t2 based on the GEOMETRY type column *obj* in table *t2*

```
iSQL> CREATE INDEX idx_t2 ON t2 ( obj ) INDEXTYPE IS RTREE ;
Create success.
```

The following example shows that an attempt to create an R-Tree index on the basis of a non-GEOMETRY type column will fail.

```
iSQL> CREATE INDEX idx_t3 ON t3 ( id ) INDEXTYPE IS RTREE ;
[ERR-31246 : cannot create index on the datatype.]
```

### Spatial Functions in Altibase

This section describes the spatial functions that are supported for use in Altibase.

#### Types of Spatial Functions

AThe spatial functions that are available in Altibase can be broadly classified as follows based on their characteristics:

-   Basic Functions  
    These functions are used to check the values of attributes, both general attributes and those specific to the GEOMETRY type. 

-   Spatial Analysis Functions  
    These functions are used to perform various analytical tasks on GEOMETRY type data.

    Spatial Object Creationg Functions  
    These functions are used to create spatial objects in WKT or WKB format, rather than in the internal storage format of Altibase.
    

### Basic Spatial Functions

#### DIMENSION

##### Syntax

```
DIMENSION( GEOMETRY )
```

##### Description

This function returns the minimum number of dimensions that are needed in order to represent a spatial object. 

This function returns -1 if the spatial object is EMPTY, 0 for POINT and MULTIPOINT type objects, 1 for LINESTRING and MULTILINESTRING type objects, and 2 for POLYGON and MULTIPOLYGON type objects. 

If this function is executed on a GEOMETRYCOLLECTION type object comprising several different types of spatial objects as its constituent elements, it returns the number of dimensions needed to represent the constituent element having the largest number of dimensions.

##### Return Type

```
INTEGER
```

##### Example

```
iSQL> SELECT F1, DIMENSION(F2) FROM TB1;
F1          DIMENSION(F2) 
-----------------------------

ASBINARY( GEOMETRY )
```

##### Description

This function returns a spatial object in WKB (Well-Known Binary) format.

##### Return Type

```
BINARY
```

##### Example<sup>5</sup>

[<sup>5</sup>] Because the ASBINARY function returns a GEOMETRY object in binary form, its content cannot be viewed in a console window. Accordingly, the ASTEXT function has been provided for use in converting a GEOMETRY object to WKT format so that it can be output in a readily understandable form.

### Dimensionally Extended Nine Intersection Model(DE－9IM) 

#### Spatial Relational Operators in the Dimensionally Extended Nine Intersection Model(DE－9IM) 

The “Simple Features for SQL” specification, proposed by the OGC, sets forth the Dimensionally Extended Nine-Intersection Model (DE-9IM). This model is used to test whether a spatial topological relationship exists between two spatial objects.

The DE-9IM describes the following kinds of spatial relationships:

* Equal
* Disjoint
* Intersects
* Touches
* Crosses
* Within
* Contains
* Overlaps

These are described in greater detail later in this section.

The Dimensionally Extended Nine-Intersection Model is used to determine whether a relationship exists between the interior, boundary, or exterior of one spatial object and the interior, boundary, or exterior of another spatial object. Thus, there are nine possible relationships between two spatial objects, and these nine possibilities can be arranged in a 3x3 matrix. 

For a given spatial object a, I(a), B(a) and E(a) respectively represent the interior, boundary and exterior of the spatial object. dim(x) returns the number of dimensions of the relationship between the spatial objects. The return value can be one of -1, 0, 1 or 2. 

If dim(x) returns -1, the two spatial objects do not intersect each other. 

For example, the intersection between the boundaries of two Polygons can consist of Points and LineStrings. In this case, dim(B(a)∩B(b)) returns the greater number of dimensions between Points, which have zero dimensions, and LineStrings, which have one dimension; that is, it returns a value of 1.

The Dimensionally Extended Nine-Intersection Matrix (DE-9IM), which includes all nine possible combinations described above, is shown in the following table.

|          | Interior           | Boundary           | Exterior           |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Interior | dim( I(a) ∩ I(b) ) | dim( I(a) ∩ B(b) ) | dim( I(a) ∩ E(b) ) |
| Boundary | dim( B(a) ∩ I(b) ) | dim( B(a) ∩ B(b) ) | dim( B(a) ∩ E(b) ) |
| Exterior | dim( E(a) ∩ I(b) ) | dim( E(a) ∩ B(b) ) | dim( E(a) ∩ E(b) ) |

[Table 2‑2] DE－9IM

The result returned by a spatial relational operator can be tested by comparing it with the above pattern matrix, which shows all of the possible values according to the DE-9IM. The pattern matrix contains the allowable values for each intersection. These values are as follows:

T: An intersection must exist

```
dim ∈ (0, 1, 2)
```

F:An intersection must not exist.

```
dim = -1
```

> \* : It does not matter whether an intersection exists.
>

```
dim ∈ (-1, 0, 1, 2)
```

0: An intersection must exist, and it must be 0-dimensional.

```
dim = 0
```

1 An intersection must exist, and it must be 1-dimensional.

```
dim = 1
```

2 An intersection must exist, and it must be 2-dimensional.

```
dim = 2
```

For example, the pattern matrix for the DISJOINT operator, which tests whether two spatial objects have no intersection between them, is as follows:

|              | I(geometry2) | B(geometry2) | E(geometry2) |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| I(geometry1) | F            | F            | \*           |
| B(geometry1) | F            | F            | \*           |
| E(geometry1) | \*           | \*           | \*           |

[Table 2-3] The Pattern Matrix for the DISJOINT Operator

In order for two spatial objects to have the DISJOINT relationship in between, there must be no intersections between the interiors or boundaries of the two objects. The other conditions do not matter, i.e. relationships involving the exterior of either object are not important. The above pattern matrix can be expressed in string form as shown below: FF\**FF\***\**

When expressed in string form in this way, the relationship can be tested using the RELATE operator.

The following figure shows the DE-9IM pattern matrix for two overlapping Polygons (a) and (b).

![](media/SpatialSQL/image51.gif)

[Figure 2-9] The DE-9IM pattern matrix for two overlapping Polygons

|      | I(b) | B(b) | E(b) |
|------|------|------|------|
| I(a) | 2    | 1    | 2    |
| B(a) | 1    | 0    | 1    |
| E(a) | 2    | 1    | 2    |

As noted above, the DE-9IM sets forth 8 kinds of spatial relationships that can exist between two spatial objects. These are defined below:

| Operation          | Description                                                  |

| DISJOINT( a, b )   | a ∩ b = Ø                                                    |
| TOUCHES( a, b )    | (I(a) ∩ I(b) = Ø) ∧ (a ∩ b) ≠ Ø                              |
| WITHIN( a, b )     | (a ∩ b = a) ∧ (I(a) ∩ E(b) ≠ Ø)                              |
| CONTAINS( a, b )   | WITHIN( b, a )                                               |
| OVERLAPS( a, b )   | (dim(I(a)) = dim(I(b)) = dim(I(a) ∩ I(b))) ∧ (a ∩ b ≠ a) ∧ (a ∩ b ≠ b) |
| CROSSES( a, b )    | (dim(I(a) ∩ I(b) \< max(dim(I(a)), dim(I(b)))) ∧ (a ∩ b ≠ a) ∧ (a ∩ b ≠ b) |
| INTERSECTS( a, b ) | NOT DISJOINT( a, b )                                         |
| EQUALS( a, b )     | (dim(I(a)) = dim(I(b))) ∧ (dim(B(a)) = dim(B(b))) ∧ (dim(E(a)) = dim(E(b))) |

[Table 2-4] Definition of Spatial Relational Operations

#### Topological Predicates and Corresponding Pattern Matrices

Altibase provides operators for testing for each of the relationships set forth in the DE-9IM. These are described below.

##### DISJOINT

This operator tests whether two spatial objects have no intersection in between. The definition of the operator and the DE-9IM pattern matrix string passed to the RELATE operator are as follows:

```
DISJOINT(a, b) 
⇔ (I(a) ∩ I(b) = Ø) ∧ (I(a) ∩ B(b) = Ø) ∧ (B(a) ∩ I(b) = Ø) ∧ (B(a) ∩ B(b) = Ø) 
⇔ RELATE(a, b, ‘FF＊FF＊＊＊＊’)
```

![](media/SpatialSQL/image52_eng.gif)

[Figure 2‑10] Examples of a spatial object for a DISJOINT relationship

##### TOUCHES

This operator tests whether two spatial objects touch each other at one or more points. The definition of the operator and the DE-9IM pattern matrix string passed to the RELATE operator are as follows:

```
TOUCHES(a, b) 
⇔ (I(a) ∩ I(b) = Ø) ∧ (B(a) ∩ I(b) ≠ Ø) ∨ (I(a) ∩ B(b) ≠ Ø) ∨ (B(a) ∩ B(b) ≠ Ø)) 
⇔ RELATE (a, b, ‘FT＊＊＊＊＊＊＊’) ∨ RELATE (a, b, ‘F＊＊T＊＊＊＊＊’) ∨ RELATE (a, b, ‘F＊＊＊T＊＊＊＊’)
```

![](media/SpatialSQL/image52_eng.gif)

[Figure 2‑11] Examples of a spatial object for a TOUCHES relationship

##### WITHIN

This operator tests whether the first spatial object completely includes the second spatial object. The definition of the operator and the DE-9IM pattern matrix string passed to the RELATE operator are as follows:

```
WITHIN(a, b) 
⇔ (I(a) ∩ I(b) ≠ Ø) ∧ (I(a) ∩ E(b) =Ø) ∧ (B(a) ∩ E(b) =Ø)) 
⇔ RELATE (a, b, ‘TF＊F＊＊＊＊＊’)
```

![](media/SpatialSQL/image54_eng.gif)

[Figure 2‑12] Examples of a spatial object for a TOUCHES relationship

In the above figure, the grey spatial object represents spatial object a and the black spatial object represents spatial object b.

##### CONTAINS

This operator tests whether the second spatial object completely includes the first spatial object. This operator is the reverse of the WITHIN operator. The definition of the operator is as follows:

```
CONTAINS(a, b) ⇔ WITHIN(b, a)
```

![](media/SpatialSQL/image55_eng.gif)

[Figure 2‑13] Examples of a spatial object for a CONTAINS relationship

In the above figure, the black spatial object represents spatial object a and the grey spatial object represents spatial object b. In all cases, spatial object a contains spatial object b.

##### OVERLAPS

This operator tests whether two spatial objects having the same number of dimensions include only a part of each other. The OVERLAPS relationship is defined differently depending on the spatial objects in question: Polygon and Polygon, LineString and LineString, Point and Point. The OVERLAPS relationship between LineString and LineString is as follows:

```
OVERLAPS(a, b) 
⇔ (dim(I(a) ∩ I(b) = 1) ∧ (I(a) ∩ E(b)≠ Ø) ∧ (E(a) ∩ I(b) ≠ Ø)) 
⇔ RELATE (a, b, ‘1＊T＊＊＊T＊＊’)
The OVERLAPS relationship between other kinds of spatial objects is defined as follows:
OVERLAPS(a, b) 
⇔ (I(a) ∩ I(b) ≠ Ø) ∧ (I(a) ∩ E(b)≠ Ø) ∧ (E(a) ∩ I(b) =Ø)) 
⇔ RELATE (a, b, ‘T＊T＊＊＊T＊＊’)
```

![](media/SpatialSQL/image56_eng.gif)

[Figure 2‑14] Examples of a spatial object for a OVERLAPS relationship

##### CROSSES

This operator tests whether two spatial objects intersect each other. Additionally, it can also be used to test for an intersection between two LineStrings. The CROSSES relationship is defined differently depending on the spatial objects in question: Point and LineString, Point and Polygon, LineString and LineString, LineString and Polygon. 

The CROSSES relationship between LineString and LineString is defined as follows:

```
CROSSES(a, b) 
⇔ (dim(I(a) ∩ I(b)) = 0 
⇔ RELATE (a, b, ‘0＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊’)
```

The CROSSES relationship between other combinations of object subtypes is defined as follows:

```
CROSSES(a, b) 
⇔ (I(a) ∩ I(b) ≠ Ø) ∧ (I(a) ∩ E(b) ≠ Ø) 
⇔ RELATE (a, b, ‘T＊T＊＊＊＊＊＊’)
```

![](media/SpatialSQL/image57_eng.gif)

[Figure 2‑15] Examples of a spatial object for a CROSSES relationship

##### INTERSECTS

The definition of this operator is as follows:

```
INTERSECTS(a, b) ⇔！ DISJOINT(a, b)
```

##### EQUALS

This operator tests whether two spatial objects are topologically identical. The following figure shows examples of the EQUALS relationship between spatial objects:

## 3. Spatial Application Development

------------------

This chapter describes the Spatial API, which can be used by an application developer to access spatial data.

### Using the Spatial API

This section describes how to use the Spatial API. For more information on the ODBC CLI, please refer to the *CLI User's Manual*.

#### The Relationship between the Spatial API and the ODBC CLI

The Spatial API is a library that is useful for accessing spatial objects via the ODBC CLI. It is used together with the ODBC CLI to write an ODBC application that uses spatial objects. As shown in the following diagram, the Spatial API is not directly called using the ODBC CLI, nor is it used to access an Altibase server directly. Rather, it is used alongside the ODBC CLI and an Altibase server to create and interpret spatial data.

![](media/SpatialSQL/image59.gif)

#### Basic Usage

As shown in the following diagram, a typical ODBC application can be divided into 3 stages. The Spatial API is called between these stages.

-   Initial Configuration

-   Transaction Processing

-   Termination

Certain tasks, such as processing diagnostic messages, are conducted throughout an application, and thus do not fall into only one of the above three stages.

![](media/SpatialSQL/image60_eng.gif)

#### Initial Configuration 

In this stage, environment settings are made, and connection handles are allocated and initialized. The handles that must be allocated during the initial configuration include those that are needed to call the Spatial API. The order in which the Spatial API or the ODBC API is initialized is irrelevant.

#### Transcation Processing

in the following diagram. Between ODBC calls, spatial object creation and search functions are called in order to manipulate spatial objects.

![](media/SpatialSQL/image61_eng.gif)

#### Termination 

After the handles that were allocated to the application are terminated and allocated memory freed, the application itself is terminated.

### Examples of Application Programming

#### Search for Spatial Object 

The general method of querying spatial objects is shown below. 

The ODBC CLI is used to execute a SELECT statement to search for records. 

The Spatial API is used to interpret the GEOMETRY type columns in the retrieved records.

![](media/SpatialSQL/image62.gif)

A sample application in which spatial objects are queried can be found at: 

```
$ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/SPATIAL/selectObject.cpp
```

#### Inserting, Updating, and Deleting Spatial Objects

Generally, spatial objects are inserted, updated and deleted as shown below. 

First, the Spatial API is used to create a spatial object. 

Then, the ODBC CLI is used to execute an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement.

![](media/SpatialSQL/image63.gif)

Sample applications in which spatial objects are inserted, updated and deleted can be found at:

-   \$ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/SPATIAL/insertObject.cpp

-   \$ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/SPATIAL/deleteObject.cpp

-   \$ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/SPATIAL/updateObject.cpp

### Data Types and Functions for Use with the Spatial API

#### The Names of Basic Data Types

To ensure compatibility with C data types across platforms, the basic data types that are available in the Spatial API use the names of corresponding ODBC data types, or aliases for those types. The exact data type definitions can be checked by viewing the contents of: $ALTIBASE_HOME/include/acsTypes.h 

The following table provides a brief description of each of the basic data types:

| ODBC Type    | Alias Name | Meaning                                                                               |

[Table 3‑1] The Names of Basic Data Types

#### The Structure of Spatial Data Types

The names of the spatial object data structures that are stored internally in the Altibase server have the prefix “std” (which stands for “Spatio-Temporal Datatype”). Each data structure is stored, managed and interpreted in the same way on the server as it is in client applications

The definitions of these data structures can be checked by viewing the contents of: $ALTIBASE_HOME/include/stdNativeTypes.i

These functions are classified as follows, and are described in corresponding sections:

-   Handle & Error Management Functions

-   Spatial Object Creation Functions

Refer to \$ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/SPATIAL/insertObject.cpp file.

-   Spatial Object Querying Functions

Refer to \$ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/SPATIAL/selectObject.cpp file.

-   Endian Functions

The interface for each function can also be checked directly by viewing the following file: 

```

```
ACSFreeEnv
```

##### Example

```
ACSHENV sAcsEnv;
if ( ACSAllocEnv(&sAcsEnv) != ACS_SUCCESS )
{
    printf("ACSAllocEnv error!!₩n");
    exit(-1);
}
```

#### ACSFreeEnv

This function terminates a Spatial API handle.

##### Syntax

```
ACSRETURN ACSFreeEnv( ACSHENV  aHandle );
```

## Appendix A. Limitations on the Use of Spatial Data in Altiabase

With the expansion of Altibase into the realm of spatial data, inevitably some of Altibase's extensive functionality lacks support for use with spatial data. The current limitations are explained in detail in this Appendix.

### Limitations on GEOMETRY Type Columns

#### Constraints

In Altibase, the use of various kinds of constraints is supported to ensure the validity of data. 

Currently, the only constraint that can be applied to GEOMETRY type columns is the NOT NULL constraint. None of the other constraints can be used with spatial data.

#### SRID (Spatial Reference Identifier)

SRID (Spatial Reference Identifier) is an identifier specified to identify a spatial object. SRID can be applied to GEOMETRY column, and SRID can be assigned to GEOMETRY object that inserts into table.

The SRID of the GEOMETRY object INSERTing into the table must match or equal zero to the SIRD of the corresponding column. If the SRID of column or object, the default value of 0.

The SRID of a column can be changed by using the ALTER TABLE MODIFY COLUMN statement. In this case, the SRID of all objects inserted into column must match or be 0.

##### Example

```
CREATE TABLE T1 (I1 GEOMETRY);
INSERT INTO T1 VALUES(GEOMETRY'POINT(1 1)');
INSERT INTO T1 VALUES(GEOMETRY'SRID=99;POINT(1 1)');
 
-- FAIL
iSQL> ALTER TABLE T1 MODIFY COLUMN I1 SRID 100;
[ERR-31461 : Invalid SRID datatype.]
 
-- SUCCESS
iSQL> ALTER TABLE T1 MODIFY COLUMN I1 SRID 99;
Alter success.
```

#### Indexes 

The R-Tree index is provided for use in indexing spatial data. The R-Tree index cannot be created with the UNIQUE attribute, and cannot be created on the basis of multiple columns. 

If a NOT NULL constraint does not exist on a column composing an R-Tree index, caution is required as the result can differ depending on whether or not the R-Tree index is used for query execution. The leaf node of an R-Tree index contains neither the NULL nor EMPTY value. Therefore, neither the NULL nor EMPTY value affects queries which use an R-Tree index as below.

```
CREATE TABLE T1 (I1 GEOMETRY) TABLESPACE SYS_TBS_DISK_DATA;
CREATE INDEX T1_I1_IDX ON T1(I1);
INSERT INTO T1 VALUES (NULL);

iSQL>  SELECT /*+ index(t1, T1_I1_IDX) */ count(*) from T1;
COUNT
-----------------------
0
1 row selected.
```

However, if the full scan hint is specified in a query as below, the query result is affected by the NULL or EMPTY value stored in the column of an R-Tree index.

```
iSQL>  SELECT /*+ full scan(T1) */ count(*) from T1;
COUNT
-----------------------
1
1 row selected.
```

#### Triggers

The same limitations that apply to the use of triggers with stored procedures also apply to the use of triggers with spatial data. Additionally, the value of a GEOMETRY type column, including the so-called “before-image” and “after-image” values, cannot be used in a trigger.

#### Stored Procedures

GEOMETRY type data cannot be used as stored procedure parameters or as local variables within stored procedures.

#### Stored Functions

GEOMETRY Type cannot be used for parameter, return type, and local variable. 

## Appendix B. Spatial Schema

This Appendix provides a reference for the table schema and data used in the examples throughout this manual.

## Appendix C. Geometry Reference Tables

This Appendix discusses how to install and use the SPATIAL_REF_SYS and GEOMETRY_COLUMNS meta tables, which satisfy the OGC standard, and additionally outlines the limitations related to their use.

### Geometry Reference Tables 

The geometry reference tables are used to manage Spatial Reference IDs (SRIDs) and the Spatial Reference System (SRS).

#### Limitation

- The GEOMETRY_COLUMNS and SYSTEM_.SYS_GEOMETRIES tables are generic meta tables and are used only for reference.

#### GEOMETRY_COLUMNS

The GEOMETRY_COLUMNS meta table is used to define and manage SRIDs (Spatial Reference IDs) for GEOMETRY type columns.

This table is a synonym of the SYSTEM_.SYS_GEOMETRY_COLUMNS\_ meta table.

| Column name     | Type         | Description          |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| F_TABLE_SCHEMA    | VARCHAR(128) | This is the name of the owner of the table. |
| F_TABLE_NAME      | VARCHAR(128) | This is the name of the table. |
| F_GEOMETRY_COLUMN | VARCHAR(128) | This is the name of the GEOMETRY type column. |
| COORD_DIMENSION | INTERGER     | This is the number of dimensions of the GEOMETRY type object stored in the GEOMETRY type column. |
| SRID            | INTERGER     | This is the Spatial Reference Identifier. |

#### SPATIAL_REF_SYS

The SPATIAL_REF_SYS meta table is used to manage information about Spatial Reference Identifiers (SRIDs) and the corresponding Spatial Reference System (SRS).

This table is a synonym of the SYSTEM\_.USER_SRS meta table.

To read Spatial Reference System meta data into SPATIAL_REF_SYS table, the ADD_SPATIAL_REF_SYS and DELETE_SPATIAL_REF_SYS procedures must be used.

| Column name | Type           | Description                                          |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| SRID        | INTEGER        | This is an internally used Spatial Reference Identifier. |
| AUTH_NAME   | VARCHAR(256)    | This is a standard name.                     |
| AUTH_SRID   | INTERGER       | This is a standard Spatial Reference Identifier. |
| SRTEXT      | VARCHAR (2048) | This is a description of the Spatial Reference System in OGC-WKT form. |
| PROJ4TEXT   | VARCHAR (2048) | This is information for use with PROJ4. |
