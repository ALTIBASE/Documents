New Features
============

### BUG-49330 Improve the execution plan of WITH clauses or VIEWs with set operators.

-   **module** : qp-select

-   **Category** : Enhancement

-   **Reproducibility** : Always

-   **Description** : The execution plan has been improved by removing unnecessary execution nodes when using set operators in the WITH clause or VIEW. Do not create unnecessary PROJECT nodes and VIEW nodes. Among the set operators, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and MINUS excluding UNION are applicable. This bug may not apply if LIMIT, LOOP clauses are used. You need to change the private property to apply this bug. If necessary, please contact the Altibase Technical Support Center.
    
- **How to reproduce this bug**

  - **Reproduction conditions**

    ```sql
    DROP TABLE T1;
    CREATE TABLE T1 ( I1 INTEGER , I2 INTEGER, I3 INTEGER );
    INSERT INTO T1 VALUES ( 1, 11, 21);
    INSERT INTO T1 VALUES ( 2, 12, 22);
    INSERT INTO T1 VALUES ( 3, 13, 33);
    ALTER SESSION SET EXPLAIN PLAN = ON;
    WITH W1 AS 
    (
      SELECT I1 FROM T1
      UNION ALL
      SELECT I2 FROM T1
      UNION ALL
      SELECT I3 FROM T1

### BUG-49398 Adds a function to retry when DDL execution temporarily fails due to table lock acquisition failure or deadlock during DDL replication execution.

-   **module** : rp

-   **Category** : Other

-   **Reproducibility** : Always

-   **Description** : 
    
    This bug applies to a replication environment that satisfies all of the conditions below. 
    
    - REPLICATION_DDL_SYNC = 1
    - REPLICATION_DDL_ENABLE = 1
    
    **Added retry function in case of DDL replication failure**
    
    Adds a function to retry when DDL execution temporarily fails due to table lock acquisition failure or deadlock during DDL replication.
    
    The difference in operation by version of Altibase 7.1 before and after applying this bug is as follows.
    
    - Altibase 7.1.0.6.4 or earlier   
      
      Abort DDL replication as soon as a temporary DDL failure occurs.
      
    - Altibase 7.1.0.6.5 or higher
      
      In the event of a transient DDL failure, DDL replication execution is retried for the duration of the REPLICATION_DDL_SYNC_TIMEOUT property. Abort DDL replication if not successful within the REPLICATION_DDL_SYNC_TIMEOUT property time.
      
      
    
    **replication protocol version change**  
    The patch version of the replication protocol version has been changed from 7.4.6 to 7.4.7 with the addition of the replication function. For the DDL replication function, all three digits of the replication protocol version of the replication target server must match.
    
    
    
    **Precautions when patching**
    
    The replication DDL copy function must be stopped when patching.
    
    You cannot use the dual DDL replication function between Altibase 7.1.0.6.4 or earlier and Altibase 7.1.0.6.5 or later. After applying this bug to all replication target servers, you must use the DDL replication function.
    
    The log below is recorded when duplicate DDL replication is performed between Altibase servers with different duplicate protocol versions.
    
    - Altibase client error
    
      ```
      ERR-61186 : A DDL synchronization receives the error message from the remote server (REPLICATION_NAME : Different replication protocols).]
      ```
    
    - Altibase Server Trace Log(altibase_rp.log)
    
      ```
