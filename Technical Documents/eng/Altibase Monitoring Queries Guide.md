# Altibase Monitoring Queries Guide

## Overview

This document provides basic information to be learned for Altibase server monitoring and examples of general monitoring query according to it. It is composed of three sections as follows:

* Altibase Server Monitoring Overview
* Altibase Meta Table and Performance View Overview
* Monitoring Elements and corresponding monitoring queries

This document briefly describes the meta table and performance view related to the monitoring query views views presented as an example.

The description of the column is omitted when it is considered that a separate description is unnecessary because the name is intuitive and the column that has already been described repeatedly appears.

Therefore, it is recommended to refer to the *General Reference* manual for more detailed information and understanding of meta tables and performance views.

* Manual Page: https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/tree/master/Manuals

To refer to the monitoring queries sample, please go straight to the section 'Chapter 3. Monitoring Elements and Monitoring Queries'.

The ERD included in this document was written in IDEF1X notation using CA ERwin Â® Data Modeler.

## 1.Altibase Server Monitoring Overview

This Chapter describes the basics for monitoring Altibase server.

### Monitoring Classification

Altibase is a DBMS. DBMS monitoring can be classified into three categories as follows.

**This document guides users through the monitoring queries needed for 'internal monitoring'.**

* Internal Monitoring: This refers to monitoring within the DBMS through queries according to the data dictionary.
* External Monitoring: This refers to monitoring from outside the DBMS through OS commands.
* Trace Log Monitoring: This refers to monitoring for various trace logs recorded by DBMS

### Data Dictionary

The Altibase data dictionary consists of two types that summarize and store all information about the database so that DBMS can be used efficiently.

* **Meta Table**

  This table is created automatically at database creation time to manage database objects. This table is owned by the system administrator 'SYSTEM_', and only a general user can select it.

* **Performance View**

  At the time of SELECT, the status information inside the Altibase server is provided in the form of a view, so that the latest information of Altibase server status can be obtained. This can only be SELECT, and the prefix of performance view is 'v\$'.

### Monitoring Method

Monitoring methods commonly used in the field are as follows.

* Writing shell scripts
* Writing applications
* Utility Utilization

## 2.Altibase Meta Table and Performance View Overview

### Overview

For internal monitoring of Altibase, it is necessary to understand the Altibase data dictionary, meta table, and performance view. In this document, the relationship between the meta table and the performance view is expressed using the entity-relationship diagram (ERD) in consideration of user understanding and convenience. This will be explained beforehand.

#### About ERD Notation

In consideration of the user's understanding and convenience, the performance view characteristics that do not have a base table are ignored, and the performance view is expressed as a table as shown below, and the key to be referenced when joining is express in FK form. To avoid confusion caused by this notation, the meta table has a yellow background and the performance view has a white background.

![1](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Technical%20Documents/eng/media/AltibaseMonitoringQueriesGuide/1.png)

In addition, in the above ERD, column of the same attribute, such as the ID columns of the meta table and the META_ID column of the performance view, may have different name according to the meta table and the performance view. In this case, the same color is given to the column to indicate the same attribute.

#### Note

It should be noted that Altibase meta table and performance view have the following characteristics.

1. Column of the same attribute may have different name according to meta table and performance vies.
2. Depending on the Altibase server version, the column name of meta table and performance view can be changed or deleted.
3. Meta table and performance view may be added or deleted depending on the Altibase server version.

#### Terms

This is a definition of some of the terms that may cause confusion prior to explanation.

* Session

  This refers to the user's access unit connected to the Altibase server. One user can have multiple sessions at the same time

* Statement

  As a term that means each SQL executed in a transaction, 'SQL(old) statement', 'Query(statment),' often have the same meaning depending on the context. In this document, it is unified as 'query'.

* Memory DB GC (Garbage Collector) or GC

  When the user excutes commit, the record before the cahnge maintained by the MVCC (Multi Versioning Concurrency Control) techinique should be deleted. Altibase operates seperate threads to delete records before changes, which are called memory DB GC and disk DB GC respectively. However, since the MVCC method of the disk DB has changed since Altibase 5.3.3, the disk DB GC disappears, so only the memory DB GC exists, so it is called GC or Ager.

### Main meta Table and performance views related to session, query, transaction, lock, service thread, and memory DB GC

The user can check session, query, transaction, lock, service thread, and memory DB GC status in real time through meta table and performance view. The relationship between the meta table and performance view in which only the main key columns to be referred join query are indicated is as follows.

V\$ memgc, which is marked separately, is a performance view for the memory DB GC, and has no direct relationship with other meta tables and performance views, but is used with a specific column of v$ transaction.

Note that the statistics information related to query execution among the columns of v $ statement is updated only when the TIMED_STATISTICS property is activated (1), so you must check whether the property is activated. The default value of TIMED_STATISTICS is disabled (0).

For reference, transacitons due to replication also utilize v\$transaction, v\$lock, and v\$lock_wait, but are referred to separately in the replication section due to the nature of the replication transaction without session number or query number.

![2](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Technical%20Documents/eng/media/AltibaseMonitoringQueriesGuide/2.png)

#### Main Meta Tables

* SYS_USERS

  This is the most basic because it can check information such as the USER_NAME as a meta table that stores database user information.

* SYS_TABLES

  This is a meta table that stores not only tables (including queue tables), but also sequence and view information, so it is possible to check information such as the object name (TABLE_NAME), which is basically used with SYS_USERS_.

#### Main Performance Views

* v\$session

  This is a performance view that shows session information of the currently connected user.

* v\$statement, v\$sqltext, vâ\$plantext

  This is a performance view that shows query information and query level statistics related to the scion, and it is possible to measure the execution time and frequency of queries. This is a view maintained only for one query that was executed last(execution) at the end of each session and multiple prepared queries, and disappears when the related session is terminated. The text of the query can also be checked up to 16K through this view.

  If the text of the query exceeds 16K, use v\$ sqltext, a performance view that shows the entire query text, and use v\$plantext to check the execution plan corresponding to the query.

  As mentioned before, statistical information related to query execution among columns of v\$statement is provied only when the TIMED_STATISTICS property is activated (1), so the user must check whether the property is activated. The default value of TIMED_STATISTICS is disabled (0).

* v$service_thread

  As a performance view showing the status of service threads, the user can check related sessions and queries by joining v\$session and v\$statement. The view itself is meaning, so it can be monitored alone.

* v\$transaction, v\$memgc

  v\$ transaction is a performance view that shows information about all currently executed transactions, and is basically used when monitoring locks. In addition, the MVCC status associated with session and syntax can be checked through v$memgc, which is a performance view that shows information of the memory DB GC.

* v\$lock, v\$lock_wait

  v\$lock is a performance view that shows all information about the lock that occurred during the execution of a transaction, and is used with v\$lock_wait, which represents the ancestor relationship of the lock.

* v\$lock_statement

  v$lock_statement vis a performance view that shows the last statement executed in the transaction that acquired the current lock, and is mainly used to quickly check the related session and statement when a lock occurs.

### Major Meta Tables and Performance Views related to tablespace, table, column, index, and constraint

Altibase is able to check tablespace and table information according tot he memory or disk (refer to TBS, TABLE box) due to the nature of hybrid DBMS. in the case of segment, each perofrmance view related to v\$segment (purple) the user can check the detailed resource usage status through. 

However, in the case of an index, as a meta table or performance view for measuring the memory index size is not currently provided, the total number of records in the table should be replaced by multiplying the memory index size for one record by 16 bytes.

For a disk index, refer to v\$index, and real-time size can be measured through the corresponding segment.

The following shows the relationship between meta tables and performance views in which only key columns to refer to are used in join queries related to table spaces, tables, columns, indexes, and constraints.

![3](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Technical%20Documents/eng/media/AltibaseMonitoringQueriesGuide/3.png)

As a special feature, when joining between the main metatable SYS_TABLE_ and another metatable, TABLE_ID is used as the join column, and when joining with the performance view, the alternative key is the TABLE_OID column (blue).

Although not indicated for reference, all of the metatables except SYS_USERS_ and SYS_TABLES_ have both USER_ID and TABLE_ID columns for convenience of the query. Performance view v\$segment and v\$index also have a table_OID column considering the sum of each table.

#### Main Meta Tables

* SYS_COLUMNS_

  As a meta table that stores column information for all tables, detailed information such as the column name (COLUMN_NAME), data type (DATA_TYPE), and column order (COLUMN_ORDER) can be checked.

* SYS_CONSTRAINTS_

  As a meta table that stores the constraint information of the table, the constraint type (CONSTRAINT_TYPE) can be checked, and in the case of constraints such as PK, FK, and UK, the index number (INDEX_ID) can be checked. Also, in the case of FK, a reference table (REFERENCED_TABLE_ID) can also be checked.

* SYS_CONSTRAINT_COLUMNS

  This is a meta table that can check the column number (COLUMN_ID) of the column that is the target of the constraint and is associated with the related constraint number (CONSTRAINT_ID).

* SYS_INDICES_

  As a meta table that stores all index information, detailed information such as index name (INDEX_NAME), table space number (TBS_ID), index type (INDEX_TYPE), and number of constituent columns (COLUMN_CNT) can be checked.

#### Main Performance Views

* v\$tablespaces

  This is a performance view that shows all tablespace information and is basically used when monitoring tablespace.

* v\$mem_tablspaces

  This is a performance view that shows detailed information only about the memory tablespace. It is possible to find the physical memory size actually used to operate the memory DB.

* v\$datafiles

  This is a performance view that shows detailed information of the data files that make up the disk tablespace. The user can check the path, status, and size of the physical data files.

* v\$segment

  This is a performance view that shows segment information of a disk table. The user can obtain the exact size of disk DB-related objects such as disk tables, disk indexes, undo tablespaces, and temporary tablespaces.

* v$memtbl_info

  This is a performance view that shows detailed information only for the memory table, and the size and sum of pure data for each memory table can be obtained.

* v$disktbl_info

  With the performance view showing detailed information only for the disk table, the corresponding segment. (SEG_PID) can be known, so that the size and sum of pure data for each disk table can be obtained.

* v\$index

  This is a performance view that shows brief information about all indexes. In the case of a disk index, the corresponding segment (INDEX_SG_PID) can be known to determine the size of the disk index.

### Main Performance View related to Statistical Information

Through the performance view, statistics information on wait events and operations at the DBMS level, session level, and query level, such as DBMS level disk tablespace data file I / O, memory usage buffer pool statistics, etc. Various statistical information can be checked.

Standards for generating statistical information vary depending on the level.

* **DBMS Level Statistics**

  Information is accumulated from the start of the Altibase server and initialized when Altibase is shut down. Therefore, in order to know the value of specific period, (current value-value at the start of measurement) must be calculated for all column values.

* **Session Level Statistics**

  The releted session is maintained while connected.

* **Query Level Statistics**

  It is maintained only for one query that was executed last at the end of each session and.multiple prepared queries, and it disappears when the related session ends. Statistics at the query level are provided through the v\$statement already mentioned in the query section, and are omitted in this section.

It should be noted that since the TIMED_STATISTICS property must be activated(1), it is necessary to check whether the property is activated. The default value of TIMED_STATISTICS is disabled(0).

The TIMED_STATISTICS property has been provided since Altibase 5. The user can check whether or not this property is activated with the following sentence.

```
SELECT NAME, VALUE1 FROM V$PROPERTY WHERE NAME = 'TIMED_STATISTICS';
```

Most of the performance views related to statistical information can be monitored by the view itself, so no join is necessary, but in the case of statistical information about I\O of data files in the standby event, operation, and disk tablespace. It is necessary to check by associating with a specific session or data file.

In order to obtain related information, the relationship between the meta table and performance view in which only the key columns to be referenced in the join query is referenced is as follows.

![4](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Technical%20Documents/eng/media/AltibaseMonitoringQueriesGuide/4.png)

#### Waiting Event Related Performance View

The waiting event means a series of waiting jobs of 'session' or 'Altibase threads'. For example, a thread called a service thread is waiting to acquire a latch of a patch to access a page loaded in a disk buffer, and waiting to acquire a latch of a log buffer to write a log.

For reference, Altibase classifies wait events into 8 types using the upper level, the wait event class.

* v\$system_wait_class

  Statistical information about waiting events of 'Session' or 'Altibase thread' is shown for each 'Waiting Event Class'. In is initialized at the end with the statistical information accumulated after the Altibase operation.

* v\$system_event

  Statistical information on waiting events of 'Session' or 'Altibase thread' is displayed for each 'Waiting Event'. It is initialized at the end with the statistical information accumulated after the Altibase operation.

* v\$session_event

  Statistical information is displayed only for the standby event of the 'session'. When the session ends, the related statistical information disappears.

* v\$session_wait

  Statistical information displayed only for the standby event of the 'activated session' at the time of inquiry among 'session'. When the session is idle or terminated, the related statistical information disappears.

#### Performance-related Views

Operation refers to the various operation performed by 'session' or 'Altibase thread'. For example, performing a query of a specific session and writing a redo log of a service thread.

* v\$sysstat

  Statistical information for the operation of 'session' or 'Altibase thread' is shown for each 'operation'. It is initialized at the end with the statistical information accumulated after the Altibase operation.

* v$sesstat

  Statistical information is displayed only for the calculation of 'session'. When the session ends, the related statistical information disappears.

#### Data File I/O

* v$filestat

  I/O statistics information for each data file of the disk tablespace.

#### Other Main Performance Views

The performance views that provide other statistical information are as follows.

Since the performance view itself provides meaningful statistical information, there is no need to join with other performance views.

* v$memstat

  This is a performance view that shows the memory usage currently used by Altibase for each module, and is a key reference indicator when the memory usage of the Altibase server process is abnormal.

  The MAX_TOTAL_SIZE column, which means the largest memory usage of the module, is maintained from the start of Altibase and initialized when Altibase is shut down.

* v$buffpool_stat

  When performing a query, it displays real-time statistics related to buffer pool such as 'hit ratio', which means the ratio of reusing an existing page in the buffer pool without reading pages from disk.

* v$lfg

  As a performance view related to redo log files, one specific column is the main monitoring target.

  The LF_PREPARE_WAIT_COUNT column indicates the number of times teh service thread has waited because the next redo log file has not yet been created when attempting to switch from the current redo log file to a new redo log file. It this value is large, change the value of the PREPARE_LOG_FILE_COUNT property to a large value and apply it (restart the Altibase server) to create a sufficient number of redo log files in advance.

  It is initialized when the Altibase is shut down in a cumulative and summed form from the time the Altibase is started.

### Main Metal Tables and Performance Views Related to Replication

The relationship between meta tables and performance views in which only the main key column to be referenced in the join query for monitoring related to replication are shown is as follows.

For reference, the SYS_REPL_ITEMS_ column name and user name are stored together so that it is not necessary to join SYS_USERS_ and SYS_TABLES_ to know the database user name and table name.

In addition, as mentioned above, due to the nature of the replication transaction without the session number and query number, the corresponding transaction is identified in the replication partner server through v\$repsender_transtbl and v\$repreceiver_transtbl.

![5](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Technical%20Documents/eng/media/AltibaseMonitoringQueriesGuide/5.png)

#### Main Meta Tables

* SYS_REPLICATIONS_

  This is a meta table that stores information about all the replicated objects, and it is possible to check detailed information such as the point in time (XSN) in which the replication target server reflects the replication.

* SYS_REPL_HOSTS

  This is a meta table that stores the information of the server to be replicated, and it is possible to check the address (HOST_IP) and port number (PORT_NO) of the server to be replicated.

* SYS_REPL_ITEMS_

  This is a meta table that stores information about the table to be replicated.

#### Main Performance Views

* v$repsender

  This is a performance view that shows the status of the sender, which is a replication send thread. If the sender is not running, it is not searched.

* v$repgap

  This is a performance view that shows the gap between the latest redo log serial number and the redo log serial number sent by the sender. It is measured by the sender, so if the sender is not running, it is also not retrieved.

* v$repreceiver

  This is a performance view that shows the status of the receiver, which is the replication receiving thread. If the receiver is not running, it is not searched.

* v$repsender_transtbl

  This is a performance view that shows the replication transaction that the sender is executing, and the transaction of the other server corresponding to the transaction can be known.

* v\$repreceiver_transtbl

  This is a performance view that shows information about the replication transaction being executed by the received. This shows the transaction of the other server corresponding to the transaction. This is a major reference when a local transaction is waiting due to the lock of a replication transaction. This is also not searched if the receiver is not running.



### Whether Users can Access the Tablespace, System/Object Privileges, PSM, View related Meta Tables and Peformance Views

Real-time monitoring is not necessary, but elements frequently identified during the operation include 'user's access to the tablespace', 'system/object authority', and 'schema object'. In the case of schema objects, PSM and views are the cases.

In order to understand related information, the relationship between the meta table and performance view in which only key columns to be referenced in the join query is referenced is as follows.

![6](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Technical%20Documents/eng/media/AltibaseMonitoringQueriesGuide/6.png)

Please note that the column names of other objects corresponding to the object number OBJ_ID column (green) in SYS_GRANT_OBJECT_ are different depending on the object.

Examples include TABLE_ID (red), VIEW_ID (red), and PROC_OID (purple) columns.

In addition, most database objects have a separate meta table corresponding to them, but in the case of views, they are managed together with tables, so specific information such as the name of the view must be checked in SYS_TABLES_. SYS_VIEWS\_ stores only the view compile status. (That is, VIEW_ID of SYS\_VIEWS\_ is the same as TABLE_ID of SYS_TABLES\_.)

#### Main Meta Tables

* SYS_TBS_USERS_

  This is a meta table that contains a list of tablespaces accessible to the user

* SYS_PRIVILEGES_

  This is a meta table that stores the authority number (PRIV_ID) and the authority name (PRIV_NAME) for system authority and object authority.

* SYS_GRANT_SYSTEM_

  This is a meta table that stores the authority number (PRIV_ID) for the system authority granted by the user.

* SYS_GRANT_OBJECT_

  This is a meta table that stores the authority number (PRIV_ID) and object information for the object authority granted by the user. Through the object number (OBJ_ID), detailed information of the object can be checked.

* SYS_VIEWS_, SYS_VIEW_PARSE\_

  This is a meta table that stores only the compiled state of the view. The view creation statement can be confirmed through SYS_VIEW_PARSE_.

* SYS_PROCEDURES_, SYS_PROC_PARSE\_

  This is the meta table that stores detailed information about PSM (Procedure, Function, Typeset). The creation statement corresponding to each PSM can be confirmed through SYS_PROC_PARSE_.

## 3.Monitoring Elements and Corresponding Monitoring Queries

### Monitoring Elements

When monitoring Altibase, the general requirements are divided into minimum units, which are called monitoring elements and each monitoring element is presented in a table. The user checks and utilizes the query and OS command corresponding to the element to be monitoring by referring to the table below. For a brief description of the relationship between meta table and performance view to understand queries, please refer to the 'Altibase Meta Table and Performance Overview' section.

### Monitoring Quiries

As a query corresponding to each monitoring element, change the SELECT, WHERE, and LIMIT clauses according to the monitoring purpose. Although there is a brief description of the column, if it is determined that a separate description is not necessary because the column name is intuitive, it is omitted when the previously described column is duplicated.

For more detailed explanation and understanding of columns, we recommend users refer to the *General Reference Manual.*

Manual Page: https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/tree/master/Manuals



### Session

The query corresponding to each monitoring element to check the session status is as follows.

To monitor only information about a specific session, add the 'id' column of v\$session to the WHERE clause.

#### Total Number of Sessions

This shows the number of sessions connected to the Altibase server.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) TOTAL_SESSION_CNT FROM V$SESSION ;
```

#### Session Information

The user can view session related information such as session client information and login time.

The following query can be used in Altibase version 5 or later, but can also be used in Altibase version 4 by deleting or commenting the CLIENT_APP_INFO column.

**Altibase v5 or later**

```
SELECT A.ID SESSION_ID
     , A.DB_USERNAME USER_NAME
     , REPLACE2(REPLACE2(A.COMM_NAME, 'SOCKET-', NULL), '-SERVER', NULL) CLIENT_IP
     , A.CLIENT_APP_INFO             -- Delete it if using Altibase v4
     , A.CLIENT_PID
     , A.SESSION_STATE
     , DECODE(A.AUTOCOMMIT_FLAG, 1, 'ON', 'OFF') AUTOCOMMIT
     , DECODE(A.LOGIN_TIME, 0, '-', TO_CHAR(TO_DATE('1970010109', 'YYYYMMDDHH') + A.LOGIN_TIME / (24*60*60), 'YY/MM/DD HH:MI:SS')) LOGIN_TIME
     , DECODE(A.IDLE_START_TIME, 0, '-', TO_CHAR(TO_DATE('1970010109', 'YYYYMMDDHH') + A.IDLE_START_TIME / (24*60*60), 'YY/MM/DD HH:MI:SS')) IDLE_TIME
     , NVL(LTRIM(B.QUERY), 'NONE') CURRENT_QUERY
  FROM V$SESSION A LEFT OUTER JOIN V$STATEMENT B ON A.CURRENT_STMT_ID = B.ID ;
```

* Main Column Description

| Column Name     | Description                                                  | Remarks                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| CLIENT_IP       | The ip address of the client application associated with the session |                                        |
| CLIENT_PID      | The process ID of the client application related to the session can identify the related process in the OS in which the client application runs. |                                        |

| IDLE_TIME       | The time at which the session started doing nothing, which is the basis for idle_timeout. <br />The unit is Unix time. |                                        |
| CURRENT_QUERY   | The query that was last performed or currently running in the session |                                        |

#### Session Information Connected With SYSDBA Authority

The user can check the information of the connected session with SYSDBA authority.

The following query can be used starting from Altibase v5, but i can also be used in the Altibase v4 by deleting or commenting the CLIENT_APP_INFO column.

The column used in the SELECT clause is the same as Session Information, so refer to the column description of the query.

```
SELECT A.ID SESSION_ID
     , A.DB_USERNAME USER_NAME
     , REPLACE2(REPLACE2(A.COMM_NAME, 'SOCKET-', NULL), '-SERVER', NULL) CLIENT_IP

     , DECODE(A.LOGIN_TIME, 0, '-', TO_CHAR(TO_DATE('1970010109', 'YYYYMMDDHH') + A.LOGIN_TIME / (24*60*60), 'MM/DD HH:MI:SS')) LOGIN_TIME
     , DECODE(A.IDLE_START_TIME, 0, '-', TO_CHAR(TO_DATE('1970010109', 'YYYYMMDDHH') +A.IDLE_START_TIME / (24*60*60), 'MM/DD HH:MI:SS')) IDLE_TIME
     , NVL(LTRIM(B.QUERY), 'NONE') CURRENT_QUERY
  FROM V$SESSION A LEFT OUTER JOIN V$STATEMENT B ON A.CURRENT_STMT_ID = B.ID
 WHERE A.SYSDBA_FLAG = 1 ;
```

### STATEMENT

This section describes each monitoring query to check the status of the query.

To check detailed time information related to query execution, TIMED_STATISTICS should be activated (1) by default. To Monitor only information about a specific session, add the 'session_id' column of v\$statement to the WHERE clause.

#### How to activate TIMED_STATISTICS

TIMED_STATISTICS is an Altibase server property that is supported starting from Altibase v5.

When TIMED_STATISTICS is activated, time information of queries performed after activation can be known.

```
ALTER SYSTEM SET TIMED_STATISTICS=1;
```

#### Total Number of Queries

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TOTAL_STMT_CNT FROM V$STATEMENT ;
```

#### Query Information

```

If this value is large, change the value of the PREPARE_LOG_FILE_COUNT property to a larger value and apply (restart) it to create a sufficient number of redo log files in advance. It is accumulated and accumulated from the time the Altibase server is started, and initialized when the Altibase server is shut down. |

### GC (Garbage Collector)

The query corresponding to each monitoring element to check GC (Garbage Collector) information is as follows.

#### Memory DB GC Gap

```
SELECT GC_NAME
     , SCNOFTAIL
     , MINMEMSCNINTXS
     , ADD_OID_CNT-GC_OID_CNT GC_GAP
  FROM V$MEMGC ;
```

**Main Column Description**

| Column         | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GC_NAME        | There are two GC names. MEM_LOGICAL_AGER is a GC that deletes the old version of the index, and MEM_DELTHR is a GC that deletes the old version of the table record. |
| SCNOFTAIL      | The number of the oldest version to be deleted, as identified by GC |
| MINMEMSCNINTXS | The number of the oldest version                             |
| GC_GAP         | Each GC means the amount of old version to be deleted. The larger this value, the greater the amount of old version to be deleted. At this time, if scnoftail> minmemscnintxs, the deletion cannot proceed because of the active transaction. Conversely, if scnoftail <minmemscnintxs, the deletion is still in progress, but it can be judged that the old version to be deleted is increasing due to the completion of the update transaction. |

#### Query Being Executed in a Transaciton Where the Memory DB GC is Waiting

The transaction that GC is waiting to refer to a transaction that refers to the 'oldest version in Altibase'. If the GC does not work and waits indefinitely due to such a transaction, the memory usage can also increase infinitely, so it is one of the factors to check when the GC gap increases.

By executing the query below, the user can see the query executed in the session where the GC is waiting for the transaction. In addition, the index scan is good for distribution, but it can be useful when detecting a query that consumes instantaneous CPU because it is a full scan. Please note that depending on the situation, it must be performed periodically and repeatedly because it may not be detected in one operation.

```
SELECT SESSION_ID
     , TOTAL_TIME
     , EXECUTE_TIME
     , TX_ID
     , QUERY
  FROM V$STATEMENT
 WHERE TX_ID IN (SELECT ID
                   FROM V$TRANSACTION

| Column     | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TBS_ID     | Unique tablespace number                                     |
| TBS_TYPE   | Memory tablespace type<br />0: As a system memory tablespace, this is a tablespace for storing meta data required for operation of the database system.<br />1: This is a system memory tablespace. This is used to stored the data created by default when creating a database.<br />2: User-created memory tablespace<br />8: User-created volatile memory tablespace |
| MAX(M)     | This is the maximum memory size that used in a memory tablespace.<br />When MAXSIZE is not specified when creating a tablespace, "UNDEFINED" is output.<br />When the tablespace attribute is AUTOEXTEND OFF, TOTAL(M) is output. |
| TOTAL(M)   | Memory tablespace is the total number of pages allocated so far. That is, it is equal to the size of the data file (memory checkpoint image file) as the sume of the 'pages in use' and 'blank pages' allocated so far.<br />When Altibase server is run, only 'pages in use' are loaded into memory. Therefore, it is difficult to judge that physical memory is used as much as this value. |
| ALLOC(M)   | Memory tablespace is the total number of 'pages in use' excluding 'empty pages' among pages allocated so far. <br />For example, if DROP or TRUNCATE is executed on a memory table of size 100M, the total number of pages remains unchanged, but this value is close to 0 because 'page in use' becomes 'black page' through page return. |
| USED(M)    | This is the sum of the 'page actually loaded with data' among the 'pages in use' of the memory tablespace.<br />For example, if the user executes DELETE on a memory table with an ALLOC size of 100M, ALLOC will not change to 100M, but USED will be close to zero (0). |
| USAGE(%)   | This is the percentage of 'pages in use' compared to 'pages that can be most allocated' for memory talbespace (ALLOC/MAX) |
| STATE      | The state of the tablespace<br />1: Offline<br />2: Online<br />3: Offline tablepsace being backed up<br />4: Online tablespace being backed up<br />128: Dropped tablespace<br />1024: Discarded tablespace<br />1028; Discarded tablespace being backed up |
| AUTOEXTEND | Whether to automatically expand the memory tablespace. <br />ON (1), OFF (2) |

| PARTITIONED_TABLE | When a partition table is created in a table, the name of the partition table is displayed. '-' For non-partitioned tables |
| TBS_NAME          | Shows the tablespace specified when creating the table. If a tablespace is specified for a partitioned table, the tablespace name specified in the partitioned table is displayed. |
| MAX(MB)           | The maximum size of the tablespace to which the table belongs |
| ALLOC(MB)         | The total size of the table allocated                        |
| USED(MB)          | Refers to the size of the table allocated data that contains data.<br/>When DELETE the data, the space DELETE can be reused, but in the case of a disk table, unlike a memory table, USED does not decrease even if DELETE is performed.<br/>To check the actual USED except for the space that can be reused as DELETE, AGING must be performed. Ex) ALTER TABLE table_name AGING;<br/>ALTER TABLE ~ AGING; Because it holds the X lock on the table during execution, other requests for the table will be in a waiting state, so be careful when performing it. ALLOC and USED always have the same value unless AGING is performed. |

| REP_GAP      | The degree of asynchronousness at intervals between REP_LAST_SN and REP_SN. (Ie, REP_LAST_SN-REP_SN) |
| READ_FILE_NO | The redo log file number that sender last accessed for replication is not updated when reading the redo log buffer for replication in memory, so the old redo log file number may appear even if there is no replication gap.<br />Therefore, the value of this column is meaningful only when there is a replication gap. |
| START_FLAG   | The driving state of replication is generally 0.<br />NORMAL (0), QUICK (1), SYNC (2), SYNC_ONLY (3), SYNC RUN (4), SYNC END (5), RECOVERY (6), OFFLINE (7) |

| RECEIVER    | Whether receiver works                                       |

#### Measure of Accumulated Redo Log Files due to failure to perform Replication

```
SELECT CASE2((BUFFER_MIN_SN < READ_SN),
                'REP BUFFER '||ROUND((BUFFER_MAX_SN-READ_SN)/(BUFFER_MAX_SN-BUFFER_MIN_SN)*100, 2)||' % LEFT ',
                (SELECT TO_CHAR(CUR_WRITE_LF_NO - READ_FILE_NO) FROM V$LFG, V$REPGAP)
            ) LOGFILE_FOR_REP
  FROM V$REPLOGBUFFER ;
```

##### Main Column Description

| Column          | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| LOGFILE_FOR_REP | When the sender reads the replication-only redo log buffer, it indicates 'the number of logs to be transferred from the replication-only redo log bugger' as a percentage. Depending on the indirect conversion of MB is possible. If this value appears only as a percentage, it can be a good thing because the replication is performed only in the redo log buffer for replication (When transmitting very quickly, negative numbers may com out instantaneously, but this can be ignored).<br />However, when frequently monitored by the number of redo log files, it increases the size of the replication dedicated redo log buffer defined by the property REPLICATION_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE to 30M or more, which is the default value, or means the number of redo log files to cache in memory for the sender in advance. Property REPLICATION_PREFETCH_LOGFILE_COUNT should be increased. |

#### List of Tables to be Replicated

This shows the table listed in the replicated object.

```
SELECT REPLICATION_NAME REP_NAME
     , LOCAL_USER_NAME||'.'||LOCAL_TABLE_NAME LOCAL_TBL
     , REMOTE_USER_NAME||'.'||REMOTE_TABLE_NAME REMOTE_TBL
  FROM SYSTEM_.SYS_REPL_ITEMS_
 ORDER BY 1, 2 ;
```

##### Main Column Description

| Column     | Descrption                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| LOCAL_TBL  | This is output in the form of 'username.tablename' as the target table of replication of the local server. |
| REMOTE_TBL | This is output in the form of 'username.tablename' as the target table of replication of the remote server. |
