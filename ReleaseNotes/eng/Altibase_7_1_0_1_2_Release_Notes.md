## Release Notes

### New Features

#### Altibase Sharding 2.0

As of Altibase 7.1, Altibase Sharding is provided. Altibase Sharding introduces sharding technology to Altibase, improving stroage capacity and throughput per hour, and enabling distributed processing of large databases.

Altibase Sharding is a hybrid sharding, and anlyzes existing SQL to automatically analyze whether to perform client-side sharding or server-side sharding to optimize the path.

Altibase Sharding supports various distributed methods, distributed objects, and utilities, and can be applied to various tasks. Altibase Sharding can be easily applied by replacing only the shard-only library without modifying the existing SQL.

In addition, the server-side sharding can be applied without modifying any existing applications. 

####  Meta Downgrade

As of ALtibase 7.1.0.1.2, a meta downgrade command is provided so that patch rollback can be performed even when the meta version is different.

```
% server downgrade
```

##### SQL Extension

###### Parition Exchange DDL Support

Parition CONJOIN and partition DISJOIN statements are provided to enable partition exchange between normal partitions (non-partitioned tables) and partitioned tables as well as partitions of partitioned tables.

* **CONJOIN**: This statement converts a non-partitioned table to a table partition. List and range partitions are supported, and hash partitions are not supported. All data in the target table is moved to the created partition.
* **DISJOIN**: This statement converts a partition of a partitioned table to a non-partitioned table. Hash partitioning is not supported, and non-partitioned tables retain the attributes of existing partitions.

###### Changing Tablespace for Table

By using the ALTER TABLE statement, the function to change the tablespace of a table to another tablespace is supported.

The user can move the tablespace storage space of the table. At this time, the index and LOB column are also moved. However, since a partitioned table can only move records of one partition, DDL must be executed several times to move records of all partitions.

###### Hybrid Partitioned Table Support

By supporting hybrid partitioned tables, partitioned tables can move data from disk tablespaces to memory/volatile tablespaces from memory/volatile tablespaces to disk tablespaces.

> Constraint:
>
> Global index is not supported.

###### COMPACT, AGING Statement Extension

COMPACT and AGING statements can be performed on a partitioned table in units of partitions.

###### NOWAIT, WAIT Support

NOWAIT and WAIT options are supported for INSERT, FOR UPDATE, and DEQUEUE statements.

###### User-defined Column Support When Creating a Queue

When creating a queue, the user can define columns.

###### Table Function Support

TABLE FUNCTION converts the associative array type or record type value returned by the user-defined function into a table type and outputs it.

###### Added Aggregate and Window Functions 

Altibase supports percentage ranking, ratio analysis function, cumulative distribution of groups, sorting function, correlation coefficient, sample covariance, and pore variance that can be used in aggregate and window functions.

* PERCENT_RANK
* CUME_DIST
* RATIO_TO_REPORT
* NTILE
* CORR
* COVAR_SAMP
* COVAR_POP

###### Added User Lock Funcitons

Functions that allow the user to request or release a user lock in a session are supported.

* USER_LOCK_REQUEST
* USER_LOCK_RELEASE

###### Other Functions

A function that returns the context information connected to the current session is supported.

* SYS_CONTEXT

The following functions are supported for encoding or decoding VARBYTE type strings.

* BASE64_DECODE
* BASE64_ENCODE

The following functions are supported for decoding or envoding a VARBYTE type string converted to Quoted printable type and returning it as a VARBYTE type string.

* QUOTE_PRINTABLE_DECODE
* QUOTE_PRINTABLE_ENCODE

Altibase PIPE funciton, which is not belonging to a specific schema and managed at the entire database level, has been added. The added functions are as follow:

* MSG_CREATE_QUEUE
* MSG_DROP_QUEUE
* MSG_SND_QUEUE
* MSG_RCV_QUEUE

###### LOCK TABLE supports 'UNTIL NEXT DDL' Statement

If a DDL is executed on a table when the session is in the NON-AUTOCOMMIT mode, the commit is automatically performed immediately before the DDL is executed.

However, if EXCLUSIVE mode is specified in lock_mode, commit is not automatically executed immediately before DDL is executed.

###### ENABLE, DISABLE Support When Creating Trigger

When creating a trigger, the user can set the enable state and the disable state. After that, the user can change the ENABLE/DISABLE state with the ALTER TRIGGER statement.

###### FIRST, LAST Aggregate Functions

For data sorted by Order by, a function that aggregates the FIRST or LAST was added. Functions that can be used together are MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG, COUNT, VARIANCE, and STDDEV.

* KEEP (DENSE_RANK FIRST ORDER BY)
* KEEP (DENSE_RANK LAST ORDER BY)

###### Date Data Format Support

The following date data types are supported by date funcitons such as ROUND (date) and TRUNC (date).

* SCC, CC, SYYYY, YYYY, YYY, YY, Y, Q, MON, MM, RM, WW, DDD, DD, J, HH, HH12, HH24, MI

###### Spatial Functions REVERS and MAKEENVELOPE

* REVERSE(GEOMETRY): Changes the point of the entered spatial object in reverse order.
* MAKEENVELOPE(X1, Y1, X2, Y2): Returns LINESTRING (X1 Y1, X2 Y2) corresponding to 4 input double variables as POLYGON (X1 Y1, X2 Y1, X2 Y2, X1 Y2, X1 Y1), which is the result of ENVELOPE.

###### Numeric Function

* NUMAND
* NUMOR
* NUMSHIFT
* NUMXOR

#### Efficiency

##### Server Performance Improvement

###### Improved Performance of Disk Buffer Manager

To prevent frequently used pages from being selected as a Victim in the buffer pool, change the flush order for recently used pages to speed up the disk buffer manager.

DELAYED_FLUSH_LIST_PCT: Specifies the maximum rate of the delayed flush list. (%)

DELAYED_FLUSH_PROTECTION_TIME_MSEC: This is a reference time for considering as the recently used page. If the last used time is less than the set value, it is considered as the recently used page. (Millisecond)

###### Memory Fetch Performance Improvement 

Memory full scan and index can performance has been improved.

###### Result Cache Support

The user can use the Result Cache to store the intermediate or final result of the first query executed on the server, and reuse the result when the same query is executed again.

###### Automatic Statistic Information Collection

Statistical information that can be used by the optimizer can be collected automatically.

###### Hints

Hints for normalization type, join method, join order, table access method, and parallel query processing have been added.

###### IPCDA Protocol Support

IPCDA (Inter Process Communication Direct Attach) is a protocol provided by Altibase and, like IPC, uses shared memory to exchange data between the client and the database server.

IPCDA improves performance by simplifying data reading and writing, and reducing idle time between clients and servers than IPCDA.

> Constraints:
>
> Like IPC, CLI and ODBC are supported, but JDBC is not. Also, LOB data cannot be used when using IPCDA. Currently only available on Linux operating systems.

###### ACCESS LIST Management Extension

The ACCESS_LIST_FILE property was added to allow access and blocking of IP packets described in external files.

##### Resource Efficiency

###### Mempool Memory Usage Improvement

Memory allocation and fraqmentation are reduced by allocating only the necessary amount when index memory is allocated.

###### Thread Reuse

The MAX_THREAD_COUNT property used for Altibase resource restriction has been removed, and the THREAD_REUSE_ENABLE property for setting thread reuse has been added.

* THREAD_REUSE_ENABLE = 1

  It is not returned immediately at the end of the thread, but remains idle and reused. When reused, calls to the system call funciton that creates threads can be reduced, so improved performance can be expected when not reused.

* THREAD_REUSE_ENABLE = 0

  Since the thread is not reused, it is returned immediately when the thread ends. (means using the system call funciton)

###### CPU Utilization During Startup Index Rebuild

Improved CPU utilization when rebuilding the internal algorithm of job threads and queues.

Also, the default number of threads used for index building has been changed.

* INDEX_BUILD_THREAD_COUNT

###### Memory Index Reorganization Support

Altibase has reorganized the index space by consolidating the leaf nodes of the memory index. When the range of the index is larger than that of the data, space efficiency is improved when it is used when fragmentation occurs in a specifiec index.

* ALTER INDEX ... REORGANIZATION statement support

> Only memory B-tree index can be used.

#### High Availability

##### Stability of Query Execution Improvement

Altibase improved the stability of Query Execution.

#### Other

##### Other Changes

###### Method 4 of Dynamic SQL

Altibase added method 4 to dynamic SQL. This method allows the user to enter the value of parameter marker during program execution. BIND VARIABLES, SELECT LIST, and ARRAY SIZE SET functions were added, and OPEN, FETCH, and EXECUTE functions were improved.

###### Interworking Support with Hibernate

Altibase supports Hibernate's dialect class so that Altibase can provide non-standard SQL.

> Since the Hibernate offical library does not include Altibase.Dialect.class, the user needs to compile and port the AltibaseDialect.java file to use it.

###### Load Balancer Logging Function

A function to record the log of the main operation of the load balancer has been added. The log level is set through the LB_MSGLOG_FLAG property, and a related message is recorded in \$ALTIBASE_HOME/trc/altibase_lb.log.

In addition, "LB" has been added to module_name in the V\$tracelog to be searchable.

The following properties have been added for the message log of Service Thread.

* LB_MSGLOG_FLAG
* LB_MSGLOG_COUNT
* LB_MSGLOG_FILE
* LB_MSGLOG_SIZE

###### Autoextend size change of tablespace in autoextend mode ON
